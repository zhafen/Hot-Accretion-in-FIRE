This folder contains multiple versions of Figure 1 combined into one for the paper.
Why? Because the root image for m11d got deleted. However,
I need to update the figure with the correct f_thin_disk.
So I'm using the old image, but new f_thin_disk value.
This is *not* deceptive image manipulation.
