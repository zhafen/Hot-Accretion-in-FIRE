% How we select the particles
\textit{
For a given galaxy we select all particles that are in the central galaxy at $z=0$ and in the CGM 1 Gyr prior.
The galaxy is defined as all gas and stars inside $R_{\rm gal} = 4 R_{\star,0.5}$, with an additional density cut of $n_{\rm H} = 0.13$ cm$^{-3}$ for gas.
The CGM is defined as all gas inside $0.1 -1 R_{\rm vir}$.
For each selected particle we retrieve the full history of the particle (including temperature, density, metallicity) throughout the simulation.
}

\textbf{The number of IDs that are accreted is 18554.
However, after removing duplicates, the number of IDs that are tracked is 14703.
Either $\sim20\%$ of the particles split, or this is a symptom of a bug.
Find out which.}
