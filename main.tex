% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
We use the FIRE cosmological simulations to study how cosmological accretion fuels thin-disk star formation in $z\sim 0$, Milky-Way-mass galaxies.
In central galaxies with a high fraction ($>70\%$) of stars in a thin disk we find that:
(i) hot, virial-temperature gas dominates the inflowing gas mass on halo scales ($\gtrsim 20$ kpc), with the accretion rate regulated by radiative losses;
(ii) this hot accretion cools to $\lesssim10^4\,{\rm K}$ at the galaxy-halo interface, with the peak of the cooling located just outside the galaxy;
(iii) concurrent with cooling the accreting gas \textit{circularizes}, i.e.\ the accretion flow transitions from a hot quasi-spherical configuration to a cool disk-like configuration.
We demonstrate that the radius of circularization+cooling is determined by the net angular momentum of the hot accreting gas.
Using a sample of \Nsample~galaxies spanning a halo mass range of $10^{10.5} M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm h} \lesssim 10^{12} M_\odot$, we show that the dominance of this accretion mode is tightly correlated with the fraction of thin disk stars in the central galaxy.
Notably, central galaxies with a thick disk / irregular morphology do not accrete via this mode, but rather are supplied by cold accretion that cools far beyond the galaxy edge.
Our results suggest that hot accretion is a fundamental building block of thin star-forming disks.

\section{NOTES FOR AUTHORS}

\subsection{Introduction - Draft from James}

From the earliest seeds of modern galaxy formation theory, there has been a perceived tension between rapid, early formation of thin disks \citep{eggen1962} and their subsequent stability and ability to survive for a Hubble time \citep{ostriker1973,toth1992}.  Our present picture for the formation of galactic disks  can be largely traced to analytic ideas first explored by \citet{fall1980}, where a galaxy's angular momentum is intimately tied to the corresponding properties of its host dark matter halo.  Collapsing structures in an otherwise expanding universe will be spun up by the large-scale matter field \citep{Peebles69};  this can deliver enough angular momentum to allow (at least some) galaxies to have significant angular-momentum support \citep[e.g.][]{MMW98}. While useful for first-order estimates for galaxy properties, models that assume a tight coupling between halo spin and galaxy sizes do not explain the detailed properties of disks formed in cosmological simulations\citep[e.g.][]{GK18}.  This suggests that our understanding of disk formation in a cosmological context is incomplete. 

Given what we know about the angular momentum distribution in galactic halos, it somewhat surprising that so many galaxies are not only spinning, but are dominated by cold, {\em thin} disks, with small scale heights and vertical velocity dispersions compared to circular speeds and scale radii $\sigma_z/V_c \sim h/R \sim 0.1$ (Kregel et al. 2002;Kassin et al. 2001).  We know, for example, that the angular momentum distribution of dark matter \citep{B01} and gas \citep{Stewart13,DeFelippis2020} in galactic halos is quite broad.  This means that in order for a tightly-ordered thin disk to emerge, the gas must be very well mixed and coherently aligned along a single plane {\em before} star formation proceeds.  This suggests that the ability for gas to mix and exchange angular momentum prior to becoming dense enough for star formation will be essential for thin disk formation. 

The fact that thin disk galaxies are common only among fairly massive systems $\sim 0.1 L_\star - L_\star$ at lower redshift (NEED CITATIONS) is an additional clue that processes within the galaxy or galaxy ...
 
The process by which gas is deposited into a galaxy from the CGM has been the subject of considerable exploration over the past decade \citep[e.g.][]{Keres2005, Dekel2006, Keres2009, Martin2019a} with broadly two paths to galaxy fueling identified: hot mode and cold mode.   In the cold-mode case, gas is deposited into the galaxy without ever virializing; this occurs typically in lower mass halos, where the gas cooling time is shorter than the infall time.
% Accretion types - hot
In hot mode accretion, which dominates for massive halos at late times, gas first shock-heats to the halo virial temperatures, and then radiates its gravitational and thermal energy prior to accreting onto the galaxy. As discussed above, we expect the mode of gas delivery, and the precise nature by which gas mixes, cools, and accretes should have a substantial baring on the ability to form thin, coherently rotating disks.  

% Accretion types - cool
In cold mode accretion, cool, $T \sim 10^4$ K cosmological filaments travel into the galaxy from the IGM~\cite[e.g.][]{Keres2005, Dekel2006, Keres2009, Martin2019a}. This mode is expected to dominate the mass inflow rate at high-redshift \citep[$z\gtrsim2$, e.g.][]{Keres2009a, Dekel2009, Huscher2020}. It is unclear, however if the cool filaments remain intact down to the galaxy, or rather heat up and dissolve into the surrounding hot phase \citep{Nelson2016, Mandelker+}, in which case hot accretion onto the galaxy would be important also at high redshift. While cool halo inflow if this kind typically contains more specific angular momentum (in total) than either hot gas or dark matter \citep{Stewart2017}, the tendency for such gas to reach the galactic region prior to mixing may hinder the ability to develop a thin, coherently aligned structure prior to star formation. The fact that thin disk galaxies are common only among fairly massive systems $\sim 0.1 L_\star - L_\star$ at lower redshift (NEED CITATIONS), is roughly consistent with the idea that cold-mode delivery is not conducive to thin disk formation. (THIS IS STYLISTIC - MAYBE A POINT LIKE THIS GOES IN DISCUSSION).

%Hot mode
In more massive halos, where hot-mode accretion is believed to dominate, there is no consensus on the specific mechanics of hot accretion or on whether the hot gas actually manages to cool rather than being reheated by galactic feedback processes. 
One potential route for gas delivery in hot-mode halos is instability-driven accretion, wherein gas precipitates out of the hot halo due to thermal instabilities, forming cool clouds which lose buoyancy and accrete onto the galaxy~\citep[e.g.][]{Maller2004, Mccourt2012, Voit2015, Armillotta2016, Gronke2019a, Voit2021}.  
% Quiet accretion
Alternatively, radiative cooling in the hot CGM can cause the entire hot phase to flow inward.
In this latter scenario, the inward flow occurs at a rate where compressional heating of the hot phase roughly balances radiative losses, so the hot gas roughly retains its temperature.
This type of hot accretion has been termed a `cooling flow' in the context of galaxy cluster studies \citep[][see \citealt{McNamara2007} for a review]{Mathews78, Cowie80, Fabian84, balbus88, Bertschinger1989}. \cite{Stern2019, Stern2020a} recently revisited these cooling flows solutions and discussed  their applicability to galaxy-scale halos.
They argued that cooling flows could be prevalent even at masses $\ll10^{12}\msun$ if halos are baryon-depleted as suggested by some theoretical and observational studies of $z\sim0$ halos \citep[e.g.,][]{Bregman2018, Hafen2019}. 

  
% The fact that thin disk galaxies are common only among fairly massive systems $\sim 0.1 L_\star - L_\star$ at lower redshift (NEED CITATIONS), is roughly consistent with the idea that cold-mode delivery is not conducive to thin disk formation.
% For Milky Way-analogs, theory predicts that hot gas with temperature $T>10^5$ K dominates the inflow~\citep{Faucher-Giguere2011a, VandeVoort2011, VandeVoort2012a, Joung2012, Murante2012, Nelson2013}.


% Filamentary accretion can often be accompanied by ``clumpy'' accretion in the form of accreting satellite galaxies and their CGMs~\citep[e.g.][]{Hafen2019, Hafen2020}, which in some cases can fuel the formation of more than a third of the stars formed in MW-mass galaxies~\citep{Angles-Alcazar2017}.

% maybe another paragraph on other 'modes' of accretion (e.g. fountains (Oppenheimer+10) and galaxy transfer (Angles-Alcazar+17))). These modes are not really distinct from the cold/hot dichotomy, since they diskuss the mass origin of the accretion, which is a different question then its thermal history and geometry which we focus on here. 

The present work focuses on hot accretion, and specifically on cooling flows where the entire hot phase is inflowing.  
From an observational perspective, cooling flows are difficult to observe for galaxies beyond
$z\sim0$~\citep{Putman2012}.
This follows since the cool CGM gas is significantly more accessible to observations than the hot CGM, but in cooling flows the accreting gas becomes cool only when it has no significant spatial or kinematic offset from the galaxy.
\citeauthor{Putman2012} thus called this accretion mode ``quiet accretion''. 
% This quiet accretion could explain observations at higher redshifts that show substantial SFRs and outﬂows with little, if any, evidence for accretion (e.g., Erb 2008, Steidel et al. 2010, Shapley 2011)~\citep{Putman2012}.
Consistent with quiet accretion, some observational studies argue that the accretion implied by cool gas observe in the halos of massive disks is insufficient to sustain star formation \citep{Binney09}, while others detect ionized, inflowing gas at the galaxy-halo interface~\citep{Zheng2017}. 

% Previous idealized simulations have studied cool gas clouds condensing onto galaxies and found that disrupted and heated clouds could condense and cool at disk edge~\citep{Heitsch2009}.
% However, to-date little work has been done to determine how prevalent quiet accretion is in a cosmological environment, as well as the detailed mechanics of how it proceeds.

% \citep{Miller16}

% Cosmological simulations
Modern cosmological simulations provide a means to understand the prevalence, mechanics, and characteristics of the different accretion modes.
These simulations include a combination of cosmological environment and galactic physics, which has allowed simulators to investigate accretion while accounting for both its cosmological nature and its interaction with galaxies and their CGM~\citep[e.g.][]{Oppenheimer2010, Stewart2011, Fernandez2012, Ford2014, Angles-Alcazar2017, Hafen2019, Hafen2020, Ho2019, Rottgers2020, Trapp2021}.
Of special note are ``zoom-in'' simulations that focus on resolving a single halo and its environment, enabling high resolution while preserving cosmological structure~\citep[e.g.][]{Katz1993, Hopkins2014, Hopkins2018, Wang2015, Agertz2020}.
Among these the FIRE simulations~\citep{Hopkins2014, Hopkins2017}\footnote{\url{https://fire.northwestern.edu/}} are a set of zoom-in simulations that resolve stellar feedback on the scale of giant molecular clouds in the ISM, producing winds that naturally expand into the CGM and interact with accreting gas~\citep{Muratov2015, Muratov2017, Hafen2019, Hafen2020}.
The resultant galaxies are broadly consistent with the stellar mass-halo mass relation~\citep{Hopkins2017}, the mass-metallicity relation~\citep{Ma2016a}, satellite galaxy populations~\citep{Wetzel2016, Garrison-Kimmel2019a}, and can have thin-disks consistent with Milky Way-like galaxies~\citep{Garrison-Kimmel2018, El-Badry2018}.

In this paper we demonstrate that cooling flows (or `quiet accretion') is the primary mode of gas accretion onto central Milky Way-mass galaxies at $z \sim 0$ in the FIRE simulations. 
We utilize the 3D nature of the simulations to explore the mechanics of quiet accretion near the disk-halo interface, thus going beyond the 1D steady-state solutions developed in classic ICM studies, and extending the idealized 3D simulations in \cite{Stern2020} to a more realistic cosmological setting. 
% Our simulations include stellar feedback processes but no AGN feedback processes, this result suggests that cooling flows may be  prevalent in galaxies where AGN feedback is weak or absent, and that cooling flows can be used as a benchmark for AGN feedback studies. 

% This paper
This paper is structured as follows. 
In \S\ref{s: methods} we describe our simulation sample and primary sample of particles selcted from the simulations.
In \S\ref{s: characteristics} and \S\ref{s: prevalence} we show that the vast majority of accreting gas has characteristics consistent with quiet accretion.
In \S\ref{s: mechanics} we analyze the mechanics through which quiet accretion occurs.
In \S\ref{s: broader prevalence} we discuss the prevalence of the quiet accretion mode, focusing on the conditions that enable quiet accretion, including an equivalent mode in halos with non-thermal support.
In \S\ref{s: modes} we compare quiet accretion as seen in our simulations to other accretion modes.
In \S\ref{s: fueling} and \S\ref{s: disk formation} we discuss the implications of quiet accretion for fueling star formation and encouraging disk formation, respectively.
We conclude in \S\ref{s: conclusions}.

\subsection{OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS/DISCUSSION POINTS}

\textbf{What are the summary points to frame the paper around, always returning to those?}
Thin disks are built from rotating cooling flows that collapse directly into a coherent cool disk at the galaxy edge (i.e. they concurrently cool and circularize).
This is enabled by increased coherence as the gas journeys through the halo.

\textbf{Add m12z, because it's messy.}
\textbf{Maybe add thelma.}

\textbf{

\textbf{Add other metrics for diskiness for comparison and to catch people's attention.

}

\textbf{
We need to be careful about how we're talking about constraints on star formation post-accretion, and be very clear.
}

\textbf{
The interpretation of Figure~\ref{f: prevalence} is still kind of confusing.
How does the aligned accretion fraction relate to the actual fraction of gas accreted via a rotating cooling flow?
From \S\ref{s: characteristics} we know that the vast majority of gas accretes via a rotating cooling flow.
However, a naiive assumption of $f_{\rm rotating\,cooling\,flow} \approx \Delta f_{\rm aligned}$ gives $f_{\rm rotating\,cooling\,flow} \le 0.35$.
This is partially because a cut of $\vert z/R\vert < 0.1$ isn't inclusive enough, but I worry that our readers will get the wrong impression.
}

\textbf{
I don't think we define rotating cooling flows early enough (or clearly enough).
We should think about where to introduce this concept.

\textbf{Do we want to compare to the jbar, Mbar, fgas scaling relation from \cite{Pina2021}?}

Do a loop through and replace Milky-Way-mass with MW mass, defining the earliest usage.

\textbf{The results could be even stronger if we could test this for one or two more irregular MW-mass galaxies.}

\textbf{Double-check the definition of t1e5.}
I need to especially make sure that there's no weird behavior in the following case:
gas that's cool and within Rgal but insufficiently dense that becomes denser and therefore part of the galaxy.
This event should *not* be counted as $\tcon$.
\textit{However}, this should be done after the manuscript is out to collabs.
If I'm being overly inclusive then fixing that will just strengthen results.
Check first vs last time cooled.
Check dependence on galaxy density criterion.
In some plots, as part of an ancient decision, I'm not plotting recycled material.
Is that a good choice?

\textbf{I'm a bit citation-happy right now, what should I trim?}

% Temporary cooling investigation
\textbf{Why do some trajectories cool and then reheat?}
They cool because of perturbations~\citep{Esmerian2020}, but why do they reheat?
Why is there cool gas visible in the intuition-building plots 100 Myr prior to cooling?

% How much to include on CR sims
Pros of including CR-analysis:
- The physical mechanisms do not require the halo to be a classic virialized hot halo.
- According to our three characteristics that define quiet accretion, quiet accretion is observed in CR simulations.
- Quiet accretion is a more interesting concept if we point out its generality.
- Cameron Trappe also wrote a paper, and one of the main differences is the inclusion of cosmic rays. I'm not sure there's room to do a third entirely separate paper on cosmic ray quiet accretion. Most things will have been covered.
- As an extension of the previous point, because Cameron wrote the CR paper we can just include a single plot or so and point to his paper for the details of how accretion works.
Cons:
- CR halos are regarded as fundamentally different to hydro halos
- Jonathan's previous work doesn't touch on CR halos.

% More terminology
\textbf{In regards to coherence, should we use decoherent, incoherent, or something else?}
Don't use the term coherence on its own, use dispersion of jz around the average.
\textbf{Compression heating and radiation cooling, or radiative cooling and compressive heating?}
Radiative cooling and compression heating.

% Not overly centered on disk formation
Are we overly-centered on disk formation?
Framing of conducive to disk formation might give your listeners the impression that this is the only theory for disk formation.

% Outer virialized halo effects
Check the following picture, suggested by James:
Far enough out in an m11 the inner halo is virialized, and compressive heating can contribute comparably to cooling.
This would suggest the cooling radius is max( edge of the virialized area, angular momentum radius), potentially true across all halo masses MW and below.
Can be checked by making an equivalent to Figure~\ref{f: before and after} for an m11.

% Decreasing halo mass implications
Do we want to diskuss the conditions under which there could be an early onset of quiet accretion for lower-halo mass halos?

% Firefly changes

% Angular momentum of accreting gas vs all gas at a given radius
How does the angular momentum of all gas at a given radius compare to the angular momentum of the accreting gas?

% Misaligned or warped disks
Can quiet accretion produce misaligned or warped disks?
Tjitske has seen in large scale simulations a misaligned disk being preceeded by a change in halo angular momentum.
Anna has some plots of this. This might be more present in the ELVIS sims.
The angular momentum vector of the CGM is in general misaligned with that of the stars in the central galaxy by large angles  30 to 60 degrees (DeFelippis et al. 2020).

% Star formation and CGM accretion
Galactic star formation is likely fueled by accretion from the circumgalactic medium (CGM), without which star formation would cease in only a couple of Gyrs~\cite[e.g.][]{Prochaska2009, Bauermeister2010, Spring2017}.
There are believed to be a number of modes of accretion from the CGM, each with different characteristics, mechanics, prevalences, and implications for star formation.
% Accretion types - hot
In the `hot' accretion mode, which has classically been associated with massive galaxies, gas first shocks to the virial temperature $\Tvir$ at the halo scale, and then radiates its gravitational and thermal energy until accreting onto the galaxy. Beyond this general framework, however, there is no consensus on the specific mechanics of hot accretion or on whether the hot gas actually manages to cool rather than being reheated by galactic feedback processes. 
% For Milky Way-analogs, theory predicts that hot gas with temperature $T>10^5$ K dominates the inflow~\citep{Faucher-Giguere2011a, VandeVoort2011, VandeVoort2012a, Joung2012, Murante2012, Nelson2013}.

One potential route for hot accretion, which has been extensively diskussed in recent years, is instability-driven accretion wherein gas precipitates out of the hot halo due to thermal instabilities, forming cool clouds which lose buoyancy and accrete onto the galaxy~\citep[e.g.][]{Maller2004, Mccourt2012, Voit2015, Armillotta2016, Gronke2019a, Voit2021}.
% Quiet accretion
Alternatively, radiative cooling in the hot CGM can cause the entire hot phase to flow inward.
In this latter scenario the inward flow occurs at a rate where compressional heating of the hot phase roughly balances radiative losses, so the hot gas roughly retains its temperature.
This type of hot accretion has been diskussed extensively by early studies in the context of the inner intercluster medium (ICM), where it has been termed a `cooling flow' \citep[][see \citealt{McNamara2007} for a review]{Mathews78, Cowie80, Fabian84, balbus88, Bertschinger1989}. \cite{Stern2019, Stern2020a} recently revisited these cooling flows solutions and diskussed  their applicability to galaxy-scale halos.
They argued that cooling flows could be prevalent even at masses $\ll10^{12}\msun$ if halos are baryon-depleted as suggested by some theoretical and observational studies of $z\sim0$ halos \citep[e.g.,][]{Bregman2018, Hafen2019}. 

% Accretion types - cool
A third canonical accretion mode is cool, filamentary accretion, wherein cool, $T \sim 10^4$ K cosmological filaments travel into the galaxy from the IGM~\cite[e.g.][]{Keres2005, Dekel2006, Keres2009, Martin2019a}. At halo scales this mode is expected to dominate the mass inflow rate at high-redshift \citep[$z\gtrsim2$, e.g.][]{Keres2009a, Dekel2009, Huscher2020}. It is unclear however if the cool filaments remain intact down to the galaxy, or rather heat up and dissolve into the surrounding hot phase \citep{Nelson2016, Mandelker+}, in which case hot accretion onto the galaxy would be important also at high redshift. 

% Filamentary accretion can often be accompanied by ``clumpy'' accretion in the form of accreting satellite galaxies and their CGMs~\citep[e.g.][]{Hafen2019, Hafen2020}, which in some cases can fuel the formation of more than a third of the stars formed in MW-mass galaxies~\citep{Angles-Alcazar2017}.

% maybe another paragraph on other 'modes' of accretion (e.g. fountains (Oppenheimer+10) and galaxy transfer (Angles-Alcazar+17))). These modes are not really distinct from the cold/hot dichotomy, since they discuss the mass origin of the accretion, which is a different question then its thermal history and geometry which we focus on here. 

The present work focuses on hot accretion, and specifically on cooling flows where the entire hot phase is inflowing.  
From an observational perspective, cooling flows are difficult to observe for galaxies beyond
$z\sim0$~\citep{Putman2012}.
This follows since the cool CGM gas is significantly more accessible to observations than the hot CGM, but in cooling flows the accreting gas becomes cool only when it has no significant spatial or kinematic offset from the galaxy.
\citeauthor{Putman2012} thus called this accretion mode ``quiet accretion''. 
% This quiet accretion could explain observations at higher redshifts that show substantial SFRs and outﬂows with little, if any, evidence for accretion (e.g., Erb 2008, Steidel et al. 2010, Shapley 2011)~\citep{Putman2012}.
Consistent with quiet accretion, some observational studies argue that the accretion implied by cool gas observe in the halos of massive disks is insufficient to sustain star formation \citep{Binney09}, while others detect ionized, inflowing gas at the galaxy-halo interface~\citep{Zheng2017}. 

% Previous idealized simulations have studied cool gas clouds condensing onto galaxies and found that disrupted and heated clouds could condense and cool at disk edge~\citep{Heitsch2009}.
% However, to-date little work has been done to determine how prevalent quiet accretion is in a cosmological environment, as well as the detailed mechanics of how it proceeds.

% \citep{Miller16}

% Cosmological simulations
Modern cosmological simulations provide a means to understand the prevalence, mechanics, and characteristics of the different accretion modes.
These simulations include a combination of cosmological environment and galactic physics, which has allowed simulators to investigate accretion while accounting for both its cosmological nature and its interaction with galaxies and their CGM~\citep[e.g.][]{Oppenheimer2010, Stewart2011, Fernandez2012, Ford2014, Angles-Alcazar2017, Hafen2019, Hafen2020, Ho2019, Rottgers2020, Trapp2021}.
Of special note are ``zoom-in'' simulations that focus on resolving a single halo and its environment, enabling high resolution while preserving cosmological structure~\citep[e.g.][]{Katz1993, Hopkins2014, Hopkins2018, Wang2015, Agertz2020}.
Among these the FIRE simulations~\citep{Hopkins2014, Hopkins2017}\footnote{\url{https://fire.northwestern.edu/}} are a set of zoom-in simulations that resolve stellar feedback on the scale of giant molecular clouds in the ISM, producing winds that naturally expand into the CGM and interact with accreting gas~\citep{Muratov2015, Muratov2017, Hafen2019, Hafen2020}.
The resultant galaxies are broadly consistent with the stellar mass-halo mass relation~\citep{Hopkins2017}, the mass-metallicity relation~\citep{Ma2016a}, satellite galaxy populations~\citep{Wetzel2016, Garrison-Kimmel2019a}, and can have thin-disks consistent with Milky Way-like galaxies~\citep{Garrison-Kimmel2018, El-Badry2018}.

In this paper we demonstrate that cooling flows (or `quiet accretion') is the primary mode of gas accretion onto central Milky Way-mass galaxies at $z \sim 0$ in the FIRE simulations. 
We utilize the 3D nature of the simulations to explore the mechanics of quiet accretion near the disk-halo interface, thus going beyond the 1D steady-state solutions developed in classic ICM studies, and extending the idealized 3D simulations in \cite{Stern2020} to a more realistic cosmological setting. 
% Our simulations include stellar feedback processes but no AGN feedback processes, this result suggests that cooling flows may be  prevalent in galaxies where AGN feedback is weak or absent, and that cooling flows can be used as a benchmark for AGN feedback studies. 

% This paper
This paper is structured as follows. 
In \S\ref{s: methods} we describe our simulation sample and primary sample of particles selcted from the simulations.
In \S\ref{s: characteristics} and \S\ref{s: prevalence} we show that the vast majority of accreting gas has characteristics consistent with quiet accretion.
In \S\ref{s: mechanics} we analyze the mechanics through which quiet accretion occurs.
In \S\ref{s: broader prevalence} we discuss the prevalence of the quiet accretion mode, focusing on the conditions that enable quiet accretion, including an equivalent mode in halos with non-thermal support.
In \S\ref{s: modes} we compare quiet accretion as seen in our simulations to other accretion modes.
In \S\ref{s: fueling} and \S\ref{s: disk formation} we discuss the implications of quiet accretion for fueling star formation and encouraging disk formation, respectively.
We conclude in \S\ref{s: conclusions}.
% We offer some brief insight on observational expectations for quiet accretion in \S\ref{s: observational expectations} before concluding in \S\ref{s: conclusions}.

% Antitruncations are cases where the Surface Brightness profiles flattens at large disk radii rather than steepens. From my impression of the observational literature anti-truncations are seen mainly in face-on galaxies and are related to the existence of stellar halos

% FIRE simulations
Our analysis makes extensive use of hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations produced as part of the FIRE project~\citep{Hopkins2014}.
The simulation sample we analyze, listed in Table~\ref{table: simulations_used}, were run with the FIRE-2 version~\citep{Hopkins2018b} of the gravity and hydrodynamics code \textsc{GIZMO}\footnote{\url{http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/\~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html}}~\citep{Hopkins2015}.
The simulations were produced using the meshless finite-mass (``MFM'') mode of \textsc{GIZMO}, a Lagrangian method with no between-element mass flux.
This enables use to track the history of each resolution element.
The full details of simulations produced with the FIRE-2 code are available in~\cite{Hopkins2018b}.
The FIRE simulations include detailed prescriptions for star formation and stellar feedback, referred to as ``hydro+'' in Table~\ref{table: simulations_used}.
Each star particle contributes to the simulation momentum from radiation pressure; energy, momentum, mass, and metals from Type Ia and II supernovae and stellar winds; and photo-ionization and photo-electric heating.
Star formation is limited to self-gravitating, molecular, self-shielding gas with a density of at least $n_{\rm SF} = 1000$ cm$^{-3}$.
In the simulations and throughout our analysis we use a standard flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $\Omega_{\rm m }\approx 0.32$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}=1-\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\Omega_{\rm b} \approx 0.049$, and $H_{0} \approx 67$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$~\citep[e.g.,][]{PlanckCollaboration2018}.

% Metal diffusion
The metal distribution in the CGM affects cooling processes and therefore the treatment of metal diffusion is important for resolving substructure and small clouds~\citep{rennehan2021}.
More diffusive metal diffusion typically produces fewer cool clouds, with possible exceptions for stripping processes, and many current prescriptions for metal diffusion may under-resolve metal diffusion~\citep[e.g.][]{rennehan2019, rennehan2021}.
Therefore if cool cloud substructure is not present with under-resolved metal diffusion, as may be the case in our simulations, we do not expect it to arise with an alternative treatment.

\subsubsection{Analysis}
\label{s: methods -- analysis}

% How we select the particles
For a given galaxy we select all resolution elements (particles) that are in the central galaxy at $z=0$ and in the CGM 1 Gyr prior.
The galaxy is defined as all gas and stars inside $R_{\rm gal}$, with an additional density cut of $n_{\rm H} = 0.13$ cm$^{-3}$ for gas.
For $R_{\rm gal}$ we use the same tested definition as \cite{Hafen2019, Hafen2020} of $R_{\rm gal} = 4 R_{\star,0.5}$.
The CGM is defined as all gas inside $0.1 -1 R_{\rm vir}$.
For each selected particle we retrieve the full history of the particle (including temperature, density, metallicity).

% Handling duplicate IDS
Of the particles targeted to be tracked $<2\%$ are particles that will accumulate or have accumulated at least twice their mass' worth in deposited mass from stellar feedback, resulting in them being split into two particles.
These particles pose a problem for tracking because the history of the additional mass is not recorded and likely comes from a variety of sources.
As done in previous particle-tracking analyses~\citep{Hafen2019, Hafen2020}, we discard these particles, which are not expected to affect our results due to their small contribution.

% Definition of t1e5 and calculating it
A key time for our analysis is the last time each particles transitions from $T > 10^5$ K to $T< 10^5$ K:
\begin{equation}
    \tcon \equiv t \bigg( {\rm gas\,last\,cools\,below}\,T=10^5\,{\rm K} \bigg)
\end{equation}
For gas that cools as it accretes, $\tcon$ occurs as the gas passes through the galaxy-halo interface.
When selecting values in the simulation corresponding to $\tcon$ we use the last snapshot an accreted particle had $T > 10^5$ K, i.e. the snapshot immediately before the transition.
Note that we do not account for gas particles being heated to $T > 10^5$ K while still in the ISM.
Because our sample of tracked particles focuses on recently accreted particles this is expected to be a small population that will not contaminate our analysis.
This is confirmed a posteriori in Figure~\ref{f: theta vs t}, where gas is not preferentially oriented in a disky ISM prior to $\tcon$.

\end{figure*}

% Summary picture description
To characterize gas accretion at $z\approx0$ we analyze the central galaxy and its CGM from $z=0$ to one Gyr prior.
Figure~\ref{f: overview} shows a visual overview of how gas accretes onto a MW-mass disk galaxy as a rotating cooling flow.
Gas moves inwards with a temperature $T \sim T_{\rm vir} \sim 10^{5.5}$ K, cools at the galaxy-halo interface, and aligns with the galaxy as it cools.
We show quantitatively in the following sections (\S\ref{s: characteristics -- inflowing gas phase}--\ref{s: characteristics -- aligns}) that these are the primary characteristics of gas accretion onto our simulated MW-mass disk galaxies.
We focus our analysis on accretion onto three MW-mass galaxies (\texttt{m12i}, \texttt{m12b}, and \texttt{m12c}) and contrast the process with accretion onto a $M_\star \sim 10^9 M_\odot$ galaxy, \texttt{m11q}.
These simulations are first displayed in Figure~\ref{f: stars}.
We show results for our full simulation sample in the next section, \S\ref{s: prevalence}.
% We define gas accretion with these characteristics as \textit{quiet accretion}~(\S\ref{s: characteristics -- definition}).

    \textbf{Add ``hot accretion'' and ``cold accretion'' to lines.}
    }
    \label{f: Mdot}
\end{figure*}

% Intro and figure description
We first determine if inflow is dominated by hot or cold gas, corresponding to classic ``hot'' and ``cold'' modes of accretion.
Figure~\ref{f: Mdot} shows the mass inflow rate of different gas phases at a given radius.
Mass flow rates are the average over the course of one Gyr, ending at $z=0$.
We calculate the mass inflow rate as
\begin{equation}
     \Mdot = \frac{\int_{\rm shell} v_r dm}{\Delta r} = \frac{M_{\rm shell}}{\Delta r} \langle v_r\rangle_{\rm mass\, weighted}
     \label{e: Mdot}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta r=0.05\,{\rm dex}$ is the shell thickness, and the integration is done on all particles with centers within the shell.

% Consequences
The inwards mass flux of hot CGM gas (red curve; $T>10^5$ K)  is $\gtrsim 4\times$ that of the cool CGM gas (blue curves; $T < 10^5\,{\rm K}$) down to $r \approx 20-30$ kpc.
The greater mass flux of hot gas indicates that \textit{the dominant form of accretion in our MW-mass halos is an inflowing hot phase}, rather than cold flows or cool clouds precipitating from the hot phase.
The opposite is true for the lower-mass \texttt{m11q}.
Note also that the inwards mass flux of both hot and cold gas is approximately constant down to $\approx 20$ kpc.
The constant mass flow across radii indicates gas in the inner halo is roughly in a steady state, similar to the assumption of cooling flow solutions~\citep{Stern2019}.

    The absence of accretion that cools outside the inner CGM ($\Rcon \gtrsim 0.2 R_{\rm vir}$) is evidence that gas accretion onto MW-mass FIRE galaxies is not the result of precipitation at large radii.
    In the lower-mass halo gas cools at a broader variety of radii relative to $R_{\rm vir}$, with the $\Rcon$ distribution extending beyond $0.4 R_{\rm vir}$.
    }
    \label{f: R1e5K}
\end{figure*}

% Rcon
A key quantity for differentiating modes of hot accretion is the radius at which gas last cools before accreting onto the galaxy, i.e. the radius at time $\tcon$, $\Rcon \equiv R (\tcon)$.
For gas that cools in the halo and subsequently precipitates $\Rcon$ will be at CGM scales, while for a rotating cooling flow we expect $\Rcon$ to be at the galaxy-halo interface.
Figure~\ref{f: R1e5K} shows the distribution of $\Rcon$ for our representative sample of galaxies.
All particles with $\Rcon>100$ kpc were placed at $R=100$ kpc bin. 
The distribution peaks just outside the galaxy edge, with a median of $\Rcon \approx 0.05 R_{\rm vir}$ and $\lesssim 10\%$ of particles cooling beyond $\sim 40$ kpc.
This result is consistent with cooling flows and quiet accretion, and inconsistent with a precipitation scenario where clouds cool far in the halo and subsequently accrete.
By comparison, the majority of cooling for the lower-mass \texttt{m11q} occurs outside 0.1 $R_{\rm vir}$.
Note that gas with $\Rcon < R_{\rm gal}$ still cools outside the galaxy: when it cools it is under-dense relative to the galaxy ($n_{\rm H} < 0.13$ cm$^{-3}$).

\end{figure*}

% Figure description/introduction
Figure~\ref{f: theta vs t} plots the geometry of accreting gas at different times relative to $\tcon$.
Times prior to cooling are colored in red, while times after cooling are plotted in blue.
The curves shows the PDF of $\cos \theta = z/R$, where $\theta$ is defined as the angle between the gas element position and the total angular momentum vector of the stars inside the galaxy.
A spherical distribution of accreted gas would have a flat PDF with a value of 0.5, while 
the PDF of accretion in the disk plane would be a delta function centered at $\cos\theta = 0$.
The plot shows that gas accreting onto $\sim L^\star$ FIRE galaxies transitions from being distributed quasi-spherically prior to cooling to being distributed in the galaxy plane after cooling, over $\lesssim 300$ Myr.
This indicates that cooling and circularization of the accreted gas occurs simultaneously, as suggested also by 1D cooling flow solutions \citep{Stern2020}.

    }
    \label{f: prevalence vs galaxy properties}
\end{figure*}

% Figure description
We now extend our analysis to our full simulation sample, focusing on the extent to which hot inflow cools and collapses directly into a disk.
Figure~\ref{f: prevalence} shows for our full sample of halos simulated to $z=0$ which halos have accreting gas that aligns with the galaxy as it cools, a property of rotating cooling flow accretion.
We parametrize the alignment of accreting gas as the fraction of mass with $\vert z/R \vert < 0.1$, $f_{\rm aligned}$.
The range is $\vert z/R \vert < 0.1$ is noted on Figure~\ref{f: theta vs t}, and contains $\approx 60\%$ of stars in a galaxy's thin disk.
The left panel shows the evolution of the aligned mass from 150 Myr before $\tcon$ (red) to 150 Myr after $\tcon$ (blue).
We relate alignment to thin disk formation via the fraction of stars formed between $z=0$ and a Gyr prior that reside in the thin disk at $z=0$ ($f_{\rm thin\,disk}(z=0,$ age$<1$ Gyr), or $f_{\rm thin\,disk}$ when abbreviated).
We define thin disk stars as stars with $j_z/j_c(E) > 0.8$, where $j_c(E)$ is the angular momentum the star would have if it had the same energy but was in a circular orbit.
This is the same definition used in~\cite{Yu2021}.
As above our tracked particles were selected to be stars or gas in the galaxy at $z=0$ and gas outside the galaxy a Gyr prior.

% Presence of circularized cooling flow accretion
For most halos the accreting gas is largely unaligned prior to cooling, with aligned mass fractions $f_{\rm aligned} \equiv M(\vert z/R \vert  <0.1)/M\sim 0.1 - 0.2$.
For reference, $f_{\rm aligned} = 0.1$ is the value for an isotropic distribution.
In halos with $f_{\rm thin\,disk} > 0.5$ the alignment of the accreted gas sharply increases by 150 Myr after $\tcon$---in most cases $\gtrsim 50\%$ of mass collapses to the $10\%$ of the volume that contains the majority of the thin disk stars.
On the other hand, the majority of the accretion onto galaxies with $f_{\rm thin\,disk} \approx 0$ does not align within $\tcon+150$ Myr, retaining $f_{\rm aligned}< 0.2$.
In these halos cooling of accreted gas is not associated with circularization.

% Presence of a rotating cooling flow for intermediate cases
The three halos with $0.1 < f_{\rm thin\,disk} < 0.5$ have varying levels of circularized cooling flow accretion.
Two of these three halos, \texttt{m12r\_md} and \texttt{m12w\_md}, have $M_{\rm vir} \sim 10^{12} M_\odot$.
\texttt{m12r\_md} has some ongoing thin disk formation, but is undergoing a major merger during the last Gyr that dominates the accreting gas supply and disrupts the galaxy structure.
This merger is relatively well-aligned with the disk, with $f_{\rm aligned} \approx 0.3-0.4$, and the aligned mass fraction does not change significantly as the gas cools past $\tcon$.
\texttt{m12w\_md} is a galaxy with its inner CGM is only just virializing at $z=0$~\citep{Yu2021}, and the majority of the gas accretes with angular momentum perpendicular to the galaxy angular momentum.
The third halo is \texttt{m11h\_md}, a galaxy that is beginning to form a disk despite its virial mass of $M_{\rm vir}(z=0) \approx 2 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$.
Much of its accretion is still isotropic, but there is increased alignment post-cooling.

% Change in aligned mass fraction
The link between circularized cooling flow accretion and thin disk formation is evident in the right panel of Figure~\ref{f: prevalence}, which shows the  change over 300 Myrs before/after cooling in the fraction of accreting mass that is aligned, $\Delta f_{\rm aligned}$.
Because gas that accretes as part of a rotating cooling flow changes alignment as it accretes, this metric scales with the fraction of all gas that accretes as part of a rotating cooling flow.
There is a strong correlation between the fraction of gas accreted as a rotating cooling flow and the thin disk fraction. 
Halos with $f_{\rm thin\,disk} > 0.5$ have $\Delta f_{\rm aligned} > 0.2$ and halos with $f_{\rm thin\,disk} < 0.5$ have $\Delta f_{\rm aligned} < 0.2$, including the three halos with $0.1 < f_{\rm thin\,disk} < 0.5$.

% Compared to other properties
In Figure~\ref{f: prevalence vs galaxy properties} we show the relationship between change in aligned mass fraction and virial mass, stellar mass, and the ratio of cooling time to freefall time at 0.1 $R_{\rm vir}$, $t_{\rm cool}^{(s)} / t_{\rm ff}$.
The cooling time is the cooling time for shocked gas, not already-dense gas.
The ratio $t_{\rm cool}^{(s)} / t_{\rm ff}$ tracks the virialization of the inner CGM and the onset of hot accretion~\citep{Stern2020}.
Of the three properties, only for $t_{\rm cool}^{(s)} / t_{\rm ff}$ does each $t_{\rm cool}^{(s)} / t_{\rm ff}$ correspond to a singular $\Delta f_{\rm aligned}$.
This is consistent with a cooling flow halo being a good predictor of how well gas aligns and circularizes as it cools.
The relationship between $\Delta f_{\rm aligned}$ and $M_{\rm vir}$ or $M_{\rm star}$ indicates that the change in aligned mass fraction is not solely driven by the galaxy or halo mass:
halos below $M_{\rm MW}$ all have approximately no evolution in aligned mass, and MW-mass galaxies have a wide range of $\Delta f_{\rm aligned}$.

% Compared to observable-ish thin disk fraction.
Figure~\ref{f: prevalence vs galaxy properties} also shows the relationship between $f_{\rm thin\,disk}(z=0,$ age $<1$ Gyr) and the Sloan r band luminosity-weighted thin disk fraction, $f_{\rm thin\,disk}(z=0,$ Sloan r band).
The luminosity-weighted $f_{\rm thin\,disk}$ highlights the extent to which the thin disk is observationally visible, and is closely related to the young thin disk fraction.

% Figure description
In this section we examine the mechanics responsible for the trajectories and properties of accretion onto MW-mass disk galaxies.

Figure~\ref{f: before and after} shows a selection of properties for each accreted gas element as a function of time relative to cooling  ($t - \tcon$; \S\ref{s: methods}).
The properties of particles at each $t - \tcon$ are binned together and used to calculate the median of the property (black line) and its 16th to 84th percentile range (shaded region).
We only show particles that accrete at least 30 snapshots prior to the end of the simulation, i.e. particles that are present for most of the time displayed with $t > \tcon$.
We now go through each panel in detail.

\subsubsection{Accretion gains coherence in the halo}
\label{s: mechanics -- coherence}

% Description
Figure~\ref{f: coherence} shows the evolution of angular momentum coherence as tracked by cumulative distribution functions of $j_z / \vert \vec j \vert$.
We display cumulative distribution functions centered on times $\tcon - 1 {\rm Gyr} < t_{\rm bin} < \tcon + 0.5 {\rm Gyr}$ with 25 Myrs between adjacent distributions.
Each CDF includes $j_z / \vert \vec j \vert$ values for all particles with $t - \tcon$ within $\pm$30 Myr of $\t_{bin}$.
This figure is the angular momentum analog to Figure~\ref{f: theta vs t}.
Gas that is co-rotating, perpendicular, and counter-rotating relative to the stellar population has $j_z / \vert \vec j \vert$ = 1, 0, and -1 respectively.
The dashed grey $j_z / \vert \vec j \vert = 0.9$ line indications the range of values containing $\approx 90\%$ of thin disk stars.
We outline in black the CDFs for three important times: $t - \tcon =$ -200, 0, 200 Myr.

% Overall evolution
Over the course of 1.5 Gyr accretion onto thin-disk galaxies transitions from decoherent, with gently-sloping CDFs similar to the isotropic CDF, to highly coherent, with $j_z/\vert \vec j \vert > 0.9$ for $\gtrsim 90\%$ of accretion.
The majority of the evolution in coherence occurs over $\approx 400$ Myr centered on $\tcon$, as seen by the differences between the outlined CDFs.
Before $t = \tcon - 200$ Myr and after $t = \tcon + 200$ Myr the distributions see only minor evolution.

% Before
For thin-disk galaxies the increase in co-rotating ($j_z/\vert \vec j \vert > 0$) gas fraction or disky ($j_z/\vert \vec j \vert > 0.5$) gas fraction is largest over the 200 Myr prior to cooling and accreting.
    We argue this increase in coherence is essential for the gas to collapse quickly into a disk after cooling and prior to forming stars.
    % Subsequently, the increase in thin-disk-like ($j_z/ \vert \vec j \vert > 0.9$) gas fraction is strongest over the the 200 Myr after cooling.
    % The exception is the non-disky \texttt{m11q}, which experiences little change in coherence or angular momentum direction before or after cooling.

\subsubsection{Hot, inflowing, and extended to cool, stalled, and collapsed}
\label{s: mechanics -- temp and radius}


Panels (A), (B), and (C) in Figure~\ref{f: before and after} respectively show gas temperature, radius, and absolute height at a given time relative to the final cooling time, $\tcon$.
The temperature panel shows that the distribution of accreted gas temperatures are practically disjoint prior and post the last cooling time, with $80\%$ of particles having $T > 10^5$~K prior to last cooling, in contrast with the gas temperature spanning $\sim100- 10^4$ K after cooling. 
The radius panel demonstrates that last cooling occurs at $R_{\rm gal}$ (defined to enclose the $\sim90\%$ of the stellar mass), consistent with the result of  Figures~1-4.
At earlier times the accreted gas is inflowing, traversing the inner 50 kpc of the halo within $\approx500$ Myr, corresponding to an average inflow velocity of $v_r\approx-100$ km s$^{-1}$.
This radial velocity is smaller than the characteristic circular velocity of $\approx$ 200 km s$^{-1}$ in these halos, suggesting significant pressure support $(\approx1-(v_r/v_c)^2\approx75\%)$ as expected for a hot inflow.
After reaching $R_{\rm gal}$ the inflow almost entirely stalls, and proceeds within the disk at a significantly slower velocity of \textbf{XX} km s$^{-1}$~\citep{Trapp2021}.
At the same time the gas collapses to a median height of $\lesssim 1$ kpc.
Note that while the gas is very close to the center of the disk plane, it is still at the outer edge of the galaxy, $R \sim R_{\rm gal}$.

\subsubsection{Angular momentum support and coherence}
\label{s: mechanics -- angular momentum}

% Support
Figure~\ref{f: before and after}, panel (E) shows the magnitude of the specific angular momentum ($\mid \vec j \mid = \mid \vec r \times \vec v \mid$; green) and the z-component of the specific angular momentum ($j_z$; purple).
The z-direction is defined as parallel to the net angular momentum of stars within $R_{\rm gal}$.
The median $j_z$ is equal to $\approx 2500$ kpc km s$^{-1}$, comparable to the average specific angular momentum of $\lambda \vvir \Rvir=\mathbf{xx}\lambda_{0.035}$ expected in dark matter halos due to tidal torques (\cite{Rodriguez2016}, where $\lambda = 0.035 \lambda_{0.035}$ is the spin parameter,  $\Rvir=zz$ is the virial radius, and $\vvir$ is the virial velocity).
The panel further demonstrates that the value of $j_z$ is practically constant prior to accretion, indicating the inflow conserves angular momentum in this direction.
For comparison, the dashed line plots the specific angular momentum necessary for gas to be fully supported by angular momentum at a given radius, i.e. $Rv_c(R)$.
The two curves converge shortly after $t=\tcon$, again indicating the cooling and a transition to rotational support occur almost simultaneously. 
Note that accreting gas with angular momentum significantly misaligned with the galaxy may will still become supported at an inner radius, and analysis of cosmological simulations suggests that misaligned CGMs can produce warped, misaligned, or counter-rotating disks~\citep[e.g.][]{Roskar2010, Starkenburg2019}.

% Coherence
% As the gas gains support it also becomes more coherent.
Panel E also shows that $\mid \vec j \mid$ decreases prior to cooling, from $\approx 5000$ kpc km s$^{-1}$ to $\approx 3000\,{\rm kpc\,km s}^{-1}$, in contrast with  $j_z$ which remains constant.
This trend is explored in  panel (D), which shows the distribution in the ratio $j_z/\mid\vec j\mid$ of accreting gas.
% Gas is rotating parallel to the galaxy if $j_z/\mid \vec j \mid=1$, while $j_z/\mid \vec j \mid=0$ signals perpendicular rotation and $j_z/\mid \vec j \mid=-1$ signals counter-rotation.
The width of the distribution (as shown by the shaded region) indicates the rotational coherence of the gas. 
At $t-\tcon=-500$ Myr the ratio $j_z/\mid\vec j\mid$ spans a large range of $\approx -0.3 - 0.9$ (negative values indicate counter-rotation).
% , i.e. ranging from rotation perpendicular to the galaxy to nearly fully-aligned, with the 16th to 84th percentile interval spanning $\sim 0.3$.
By $\tcon$ nearly all the accreting gas has $j_z\approx\mid\vec j\mid$, indicating all hot accreting gas particles are co-rotating. 
These trends suggest that components unaligned with the net angular momentum are canceling each other out due to interaction in the hot halo, as found also by other cosmological simulations ~\citep[e.g.][]{DeFelippis2017}.
% From $t-\tcon = 500$ Myr to $t=\tcon$ the j_zmagnitude of specific angular momentum for individual particles decreases 
% However, This increasing rotational support with decreasing radius is responsible for the stalling seen in panel (B), and is a feature of many simulations of $L^*$ halos~\citep[][]{Oppenheimer2018}.
The result that the hot halo just outside the galaxy is co-rotating with the galaxy is also consistent with recent kinematic analyses of hot gas in the Milky-Way halo \citep{Miller2016}.

\textbf{Fraternalli's group has observations of this offset.}

% The angular momentum increase
There is small-but-noticeable increase in the specific angular momentum of each gas particle at $t \approx \tcon$.
This increase is not the focus of our analysis, but we note that it may be a result of a difference in orientation and/or amplitude between the angular momentum of the galaxy and the angular momentum of the accreting gas~\citep[e.g.][]{Danovich2012, DeFelippis2017, DeFelippis2020}, which forces the accreting gas to co-rotate with the galaxy, as hinted at by the larger increase in $j_z$ compared to $\mid \vec j \mid$.
The explicit mechanism to increase $j_z$ may be exchange of angular momentum via gravitational torques~\citep[e.g.][]{Danovich2015} or via collisional interactions.
Any angular momentum gained is expected to be lost by other particles, driving inflow of existing gas particles in the galaxy or galaxy-halo interface.

% \textbf{
% This point might need a separate figure if we really want to include it.
% }

% \textbf{Do we want to add some discussion here on how the gas gets its angular momentum from the IGM, i.e. tidal torque theory?}

\subsubsection{Support leads to cooling}
\label{s: mechanics -- energy balance}

% Density
Figure~\ref{f: before and after} panel (F) shows the baryon number density before and after $\tcon$.
A pileup occurs at $t\approx \tcon$, induced by increased rotational support.
While the gas density increases significantly, the gas is still significantly below any threshold for star formation:
a minimal threshold for star formation of $n = 100$ cm$^{-3}$ is designated by a horizontal line, which is still $10\times$ less than the density threshold used by the FIRE simulations.
This suggests that simulations with an under-restrictive star formation density criterion may struggle to form thin disks, as the gas is still become coherent as the density increases.

% Energy balance description
In Figure~\ref{f: before and after} panel (E) we assess the energetics of the gas to determine why it cools.
We study the energetics through two types of change in specific energy: radiative cooling (blue lines) and compressive heating (red lines).
Radiative cooling per unit mass for an individual particle is calculated as $\nH^2 \Lambda / \rho$, where $\nH$ is the Hydrogen density, $\rho$ is the mass density, and $\Lambda$ is the cooling function, which we take from \cite{Wiersma2009a}.
Compressive heating per unit mass for an individual particle is calculated as $P \frac{dV}{dt} \approx \frac{ P }{ \rho^2 } \frac{ \Delta \rho }{ \Delta t }$, where $P = n k_B T$, $\Delta \rho$ is the change in density from one snapshot to the next, and $\Delta t$ is the typical snapshot time spacing.
Because accreting gas elements interact with other accreting gas elements thermodynamically we show the mean specific energy tracks of all gas elements binned into 100 Myr bins of $\tcon$.
To avoid outliers with artificially-large heating or cooling rates affecting the results we discard the $1\%$ of particles with highest change in specific energy.
To focus on the behavior of the majority of the particles we do not bin the $1\%$ of particles with the highest change in specific energy.
Some $\tcon$ bins contain much more accreting gas than others, and to reflect this we set the darkness of the lines proportional to the number of particles in the bin.

% Energy balance trend
Prior to $\tcon$ radiative cooling increases by a factor of $\sim 10$ over the course of 500 Myr, from 0.01 erg s$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$ (corresponding to a cooling time of \textbf{xx}) to 0.1 erg s$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$ (corresponding to a cooling time of \textbf{yy}).
The radiative cooling is however nearly completely offset by compressive heating, consistent with the roughly flat temperature profile shown in Panel (A).
This equality of radiative cooling and compressive heating is a defining characteristic of cooling flows \citep{Mathews78, McNamara2007, Stern20}. 

At $t=\tcon$ the cooling rate increases sharply, a result of increased density from gas piling up at the angular momentum support radius (as also seen in \citealt{Trapp2021}).
At roughly the same time compressive heating drops off dramatically due to the lack of inward movement.
The result is gas that cools over the course of $\lesssim 50$ Myr.

% This is old stuff Jonathan wrote. Keeping around for now.
% To demonstrate that the hot radial inflow is driven by cooling, we compare the different terms of the energy conservation equation. In steady-state, and assuming the gravitational potential is constant,  energy conservation in the radial direction dictates \citep[e.g.][]{Shu82}
% \begin{equation}\label{e: energy}
%     \rho g v_r + H_{\rm feedback} - \frac{d}{dr}(v_r P)= 
%     \frac{d}{dr}\left(\rho v_r \left(\epsilon+\frac{1}{2}v^2\right)\right)  +  \nH^2\Lambda  
% \end{equation}
% where the terms on the left hand side are the `source terms' -- gravity, feedback, and the work done on the shell by adjacent shells, while the terms on the right represent respectively the heating and acceleration of the flow and radiative losses.

\section{Discussion}
\label{s: discussion}

% Intro
% In the results section we showed that Milky-Way-mass FIRE galaxies in the process of forming disks accrete primarily through rotating cooling flows, and we studied the mechanisms for rotating cooling flows collapsing into disks.
% In the discussion we now turn to the implications of our findings.
% In \S\ref{s: broader prevalence} we discuss conditions that may enable quiet accretion to occur, including in halos that have non-thermal support.
% We then turn to comparing and contrasting quiet accretion with other accretion modes in \S\ref{s: modes}.
% We wrap up our discussion in \S\ref{s: fueling} and \S\ref{s: disk formation} with the implications of quiet accretion for fueling star formation and disk formation.
\textbf{Re-add an intro once the discussion is re-organized. Or maybe not.}

\subsection{Rotating cooling flows and disk formation}
\label{s: disk formation}

In \S\ref{s: characteristics} we showed rotating cooling flows collapse directly into a disk at the galaxy halo interface, in \S\ref{s: mechanics} we assessed the mechanics responsible for this behavior, and in \S\ref{s: prevalence} we showed there is a strong correlation between rotating cooling flows and thin disk formation.
We now assess several other aspects of the connection between rotating cooling flows and disk formation.

% Importance of L*
Galaxies with a mass comparable to the MW have long been of special interest, both because of their relation to our galaxy and because the mass is thought to be a critical mass at which many properties of galaxies and the CGM change change~\citep[e.g.][]{Fielding2017, Correa2017, Dekel2019a}.

% FIRE-centric recent work
In the FIRE simulations properties that change at $M_{\rm h}\sim10^{12} M_\odot$ include a transition from a supersonic and free-falling inner CGM to a subsonic and virialized inner CGM;
a transition from bursty to steady star formation;
a transition from dispersion and pressure supported to rotationally supported;
and a transition from spheroidal or thick disk to thin disk stellar morphology~(\citealt{El-Badry2018a, Stern2020, Yu2021}, Gurvich et al., in prep).
Rotating cooling flows become the main mode of accretion at the time the halo virializes~(Figure~\ref{f: prevalence vs galaxy properties}).
If rotating-cooling-flow accretion is a condition for disk formation then this explains the correlation between the presence of a virialized halo and thin disk formation.
This is independent of the behavior of the galaxy, provided galactic feedback is not affecting the CGM in a way that disrupts the cooling flow.
The strong correlation between rotating cooling flows and thin disk formation (Figure~\ref{f: prevalence} suggests rotating cooling flows are a sufficient condition for disk formation, but confirmation of this requires analysis of the ISM in addition to the existing CGM-focused analysis.
This is the subject of ongoing work (Gurvich et al., in prep).

\subsubsection{Accretion modes conducive to disk formation}
\label{s: disk formation -- conducive}

\textbf{
This section can probably be cut down/removed.
The points here are not as strong.
Any framing of other modes should be brought back to disk formation.
}


% General point
In thin-disk-forming galaxies gas must be disk-like \textit{prior} to becoming star forming, or it will form stars in a morphology other than a thin disk.
This is especially important because it is challenging to produce thin disks from existing stars, unlike spheroidal or irregular stellar morphologies.
This suggests that accretion modes that deliver gas that is already disk-like prior to becoming star forming are much more conducive to thin disk formation.

% Conduciveness of rotating cooling flows
As stated previously, rotating cooling deliver gas that is already disk-like prior to becoming star forming (the density evolution is displayed in panel F of Figure~\ref{f: before and after}).
No other known accretion mode provides fuel that is as clearly conducive to disk formation.

% Cold flows and satellites
While simulations predict that cold flow streams are on-average aligned with the central galaxy, they also predict that the variability between stream alignmens is very large~\citep[e.g.][]{Danovich2012, Stewart2011a, Stewart2013, Stewart2017}.
The same is true for gas accreted from satellite galaxies or their winds~\citep[e.g.][]{Stewart2011, Hafen2019}.
As such, the accreting gas from these modes will enter the galaxy without already being aligned in a co-rotating disk.
Cold flows and satellite accretion is also highly time-variable, leading to large bursts in star formation~\citep[e.g.][]{Muratov2015, Muratov2017}.

% Precipitation
We also expect the accretion mode of precipitation to be less conducive to disk formation than rotating cooling flows.
Precipitation by definition cools farther out in the halo.
As such, precipitating gas spends less time hot and therefore has less time to cancel out random angular momentum through thermal contact with other gas.
The accreting gas will therefore enter the galaxy with a wider variety of angular momenta and directions than rotating cooling flows.

% Galactic fountains
Recycled winds, especially in the form of a smooth galactic fountain, may be an exception.
If recycled gas retains its angular momentum direction during recycling then it may be co-rotating as it re-accretes.
If it passes into a hot corona or halo then it can become more coherent during the process as well.
In addition, in simulations with bipolar winds the wind can evacuate low-angular momentum gas found preferentially along the galaxy poles~\citep[e.g.][]{DeFelippis2017}, helping produced aligned accretion.
Nevertheless, even if recycling helps gas to become more disk-like the stated condition provides a strong constraint:
if recycled gas primarily forms thin disks then it cannot become star-forming prior to being recycled.

\subsubsection{The presence or absence of thin disks in simulations}
\label{s: disk formation -- population}

% Thin stellar disk but no feedback
The conditions under which simulated galaxies produce disk galaxies also points to the role of rotating cooling flows in disk formation.
The first piece of evidence is the presence of galaxies with thin stellar disks in cosmological simulations absent strong galactic winds~\citep{Guedes2011, Bird2013}.
If disk galaxies are produced under similar conditions in these simulations and our simulations then the accretion mode must be one that occurs absent feedback affecting the CGM.
Rotating cooling flow accretion fits this condition well:
cooling flows are solutions for hot gaseous halos that are \textit{not} strongly affected by feedback~\citep{Stern2019}.
Instead the hot or cool nature of the halo is determined solely by the halo baryon content and/or the accretion rate, which increases with increasing dark matter halo mass~\citep{Stern2020a}.

% Underprediction of thin disks at low mass
The second piece of evidence is the underprediction in FIRE of a galaxy population with thin stellar disks for galaxies with $M_* = 10^6 \-- 2 \times 10^7 M_\odot$~\citep{El-Badry2018a}, where our galaxies are fed primarily by cold flows~\citep{Stern2020}.
If having a rotating cooling flow is a necessary condition for disk formation then the absence of rotating cooling flows in these halos also explains the underprediction of disky galaxies.
Inducing cooling flows in these halos would require the halo to have a lower baryon content, potentially requiring additional feedback physics.

\textbf{Cameron's paper.}

% Shea's work
\textit{
\cite{Garrison-Kimmel2018} studied the morphologies of MW-mass galaxies in the FIRE simulations.
Two particularly relevant findings:
Disk morphology can correlate well with gas accretion history, as parameterized by the spin parameter of the gas at the time half the stars have formed.
Dark matter accretion history correlates poorly with disk morphology, as parameterized by the time at which half the dark matter mass is assembled and the predicted radius of the galaxy assuming angular momentum is inherited from the dark matter.
Our work suggests that the disk fraction is driven by the accretion mode of gas, consistent with gas accretion history being more important than dark matter accretion history.

\subsubsection{Other explanations}
\label{s: other disk formation -- sims}

% Kretschmer2020
\textit{
\cite{Kretschmer2020} study two MW-mass halos with similar mass accretion histories and halo spin parameters prior to $z=1.5$, but with one galaxy producing a disk and the other becoming bulge-dominated.
The authors identify the origin of the difference as the alignment of the angular momentum during a period of rapid accretion.
This part is consistent with our analysis, but the authors point to \textit{cold flow} accretion as being the primary source for disk formation.
The authors also suggest that decreased feedback intensity per-unit-area allows the disk to survive.
Disks in appropriately-massive galaxies (i.e. properly regulated at high z) may be a feature of simulations with high-enough feedback resolution to resolve clustering.
}

% Dekel2020a
\textit{
\cite{Dekel2020a} propose that disks form when the galaxy reaches a sufficient mass s.t. the orientation of the galaxy is not being routinely flipped by major mergers.
However, the sample of discs they study are not nearly as thin as the disks we focus on:
The ratio of $T < 1.5 \times 10^4$ K gas disk radii to half height for their disk population spans $\approx 4-6.4$, while the same ratio calculated using the same definitions for \texttt{m12i} is 9.6.
In our sample the unvirialized \texttt{m11h} is perhaps the closest to their disk sample, as its a thick disk with a ratio of 4.5.
}

% Sales2012
\textit{
DM halo properties are poorly correlated with morphology.
Instead, angular momentum alignment of accreting gas is much more important.
The authors find that hot accretion at late times is more favorable to disk formation than cool accretion, though do not pinpoint why.
They show a correlation between the hot accretion fraction and the morphology, but it's much weaker than the correlation we show.
The origin may be that rotational cooling flow accretion is a subset of hot accretion.

% \subsection{Broader prevalence of quiet accretion}
% \label{s: broader prevalence}

% Primary mode for MW-mass virialized halos
% The importance of an accretion mode to the astrophysics community depends partially on how many galaxy types it is relevant to and the extent to which such galaxy types are essential to understanding galaxy evolution.
% We find that circularizing cooling flows are the dominant accretion mode onto MW-mass halos at low redshift in the FIRE simulation, as is shown in \S\ref{s: results} for galaxies from the FIRE simulations.
% As we will discuss, this is because sufficient conditions for quiet accretion are met for any halo with an inward-flowing, voluminous phase not subject to runaway thermal instabilities and with weak disruption by feedback or other galaxies.
% These conditions may be met in some halos with non-thermal support.

% \subsubsection{Conditions for quiet accretion}
% \label{s: broader prevalence -- conditions}

% \textbf{I removed the below sentence from the results, maybe add it in here.}
% Figure~\ref{f: before and after} demonstrates that gas cools (A; temperature vs time) and stalls at the galaxy edge (B; radius vs time) because it becomes fully angular-momentum supported (C; ratio of angular momentum vs time), by which time it is rotating coherently in the same direction (D; fraction of angular momentum aligned with galaxy), allowing the gas to quickly collapse into a disk when the cooling exceeds the heating (E; change in specific energy).

% \textbf{Look through and be careful about talking about cold flows as not coherent, because people don't think of them that way.}

% \textbf{This is not yet convincing. Rethink.}

% % Voluminous phase condition
% The first condition for quiet accretion is that the accreting gas must be able to equilibriate to a sufficiently coherent angular momentum prior to cooling (as in Figure~\ref{f: before and after}).
% This allows the gas to collapse into a thin disk after cooling, a characteristic of quiet accretion we discussed in \S\ref{s: characteristics -- aligns}.
% The exact degree of coherence required for the gas to collapse neatly into a thin disk is an avenue for future study.
% One way for the gas to equilibriate its angular momentum is for the inflowing gas to exist as part of a voluminous phase through which gas can exchange angular momentum faster than it accretes.
% $L^*$ halos may have volume-filling subsonic cooling flows that fit this condition~\citep{Stern2019}, as is the case in the FIRE simulations~\citep{Stern2020a}.

% % Thermal instabilities
% In the case of our halos, \cite{Stern2019} analyzed the stability of cooling flow solutions in Milky Way-like halos to instabilities and found that they were stable to small perturbations provided the cooling time was longer than the free-fall time, i.e. gas is mixed via inward movement faster than it cools.
% Linear perturbation theory also predicts that perturbations will grow slower than the infall of the gas~\citep[e.g.][]{Balbus1989}.
% However, large perturbations such as those from satellite halos may still produce cool gas, even if much of the gas returns to the hot halo~\citep{Esmerian2020}.

% %  Disruption condition
% In addition to the prior conditions, quiet accretion may not be dominant, or occur at all, in halos undergoing significant energy or momentum deposition by feedback or merging/satellite galaxy dynamics.
% In the case of quiet accretion as part of a subsonic cooling flow, this is because the cooling flow is the ``background'' hydrodynamic solution for CGM gas flows~\cite{Stern2019}, i.e. the solution that describes the CGM provided there are no energy or momentum source terms.
% More generally, disruption from feedback or other dynamics may invalidate the previous conditions: it could add an additional angular momentum term or disrupt the process of angular momentum coherence, and there is evidence that such perturbations induce cooling of gas~\citep[e.g.][]{Hummels2019, Esmerian2020}.

% % Satisfaction of disruption condition
% Fortunately there's evidence that MW-mass halos are not strongly disrupted by feedback or other bulk motion.
% In the FIRE simulations these halos are dominated by a hot, well-mixed halo absent strong ongoing outflows~\citep{Hafen2019}.
% In addition, while half the cold gas being is associated with satellite galaxies, especially in the outer region, the cold phase has less mass than the hot phase~\citep{Hafen2020}.
% Our analysis in \S\ref{s: characteristics}, which selects particles to track with no cuts on gas temperature, suggests that this cold phase not only has less mass than the hot phase, but that the majority of accretion is consistent with quiet accretion.
% Beyond the FIRE simulations, $L^\star$ halos are at the peak of the $M_\star/M_{\rm h}$ vs $M_{\rm h}$ relation~\textbf{(Behroozi citation?)}, suggesting they may be halos where galactic feedback is weakest.
% These halos may be in a mass range where stellar feedback is no longer sufficient to regulate star formation, and before AGN feedback can suppress star formation significantly.

% \subsubsection{Halos with non-thermal support}
% \label{s: broader prevalance -- non-thermal}

% % Comparison to Trapp+2021
% \cite{Trapp2021} performed a thorough, complementary, phenomenological-focused analysis on the accretion of gas onto MW-mass galaxies and its transport through the disk.
% Their analysis focused on simulations that include cosmic ray feedback, and therefore their analysis provides a window into the differences in gas accretion modes in simulations with and without non-thermal support.
% \citeauthor{Trapp2021} find the following characteristics of accreting gas:
% gas primarily accretes as part of flared or funnel-like structures at the disk edge,
% gas becomes more coherent as it approaches the disk edge,
% after accreting gas co-rotates with the galaxy,
% gas becomes fully rotationally supported at the radius of accretion,
% gas moves inward more slowly after reaching the disk edge,
% and the disk edge is produced by a density-increasing pileup.
% These characteristics are all consistent with quiet accretion, suggesting that the conditions for quiet accretion outlined in the previous section may occur in halos with non-thermal support in the halo.

% % Analysis replication
% \textit{
% To confirm the presence of quiet accretion in halos with non-thermal support we performed the same tracking outlined in \S\ref{s: methods} on a MW-mass halo simulated with cosmic-ray feedback.

% % CR vs MHDCV differences
% \textbf{Gas should be moving inward more slowly due to extra support, and so should be a bit cooler ($T\sim 10^5$ K), but otherwise same general picture.}

% % Organization into disk: angular momentum exchange
% \textbf{
% Our analysis suggests that as part of a hot halo with gas moving at sub-sonic speeds angular momentum can be exchanged between gas at all angles.
% Therefore, when the gas eventually cools it naturally organizes into a disk.

% % EAGLE
% \textit{
% Is the cold accretion described by \cite{Ho2019} consistent with quiet accretion?
% \textbf{Finding out would likely involve reproducing the ballistic approximation, which identifies the most strongly inflowing gas.}
% It's not clear, but the cold gas around the galaxy is mostly aligned with the galaxy plane, including for the most strongly-inflowing gas.
% The hot gas that is most strongly cooling is best fit by a singular isothermal sphere, while all hot gas is best fit by a $\beta$ profile~\citep{Stevens2017}.
% \textbf{Is this consistent with what we expect? Do we expect an isothermal sphere?}
% \textbf{If important for comparison, Stevens2017 give the cooling time profiles for their halos, so we can check if it's a cooling flow.}
% In the EAGLE simulations specific angular momentum is not conserved for cooling gas, including for gas cooling onto disky galaxies~\citep{Stevens2017}.
% This may cause differences in the characteristics of the accretion at the gaalxy-halo interface.
% \cite{Stevens2017} find that the most cooling gas within $R_{\rm vir}$ has a comparable, but slightly higher, magnitude of angular momentum distribution as all hot gas in the halo.
% \textbf{I think this is support for the halos being similar.}
% \cite{Stevens2017} also find that gas will orient itself parallel to the cold disk as it cools.
% }

% \subsection{Comparison to other accretion modes}
% \label{s: modes}

% \subsubsection{Stable Hot Accretion}
% \label{s: modes -- hot}

% % What is stable hot accretion?
% In terms of commonly-studied accretion modes, thermally-stable hot accretion is quiet accretion, and vice versa.
% Stable hot accretion has been studied since~\cite{Cowie1977a}, where it was studied in the context of one-dimensional cooling flows onto galaxy clusters.
% Of note for our analysis \cite{Stern2019} presented cooling flow solutions adapted to the CGM of galaxies, and \cite{Stern2020} demonstrated that $M_{\rm h} \sim 10^{12} M_\odot$ FIRE-2 simulations have CGMs consistent with cooling flows.
% Regarding the contribution of hot mode accretion, a wide variety of simulation analyses identify $M_{\rm h} \sim 10^{12} M_\odot$ as a ``critical'' mass above which hot mode is dominant~\citep[e.g.][, and many others]{Correa2017, Stern2020}.
% Previous work has also demonstrated the importance of rotation for supporting the inner CGM of MW-like halos~\citep{Oppenheimer2018}.

% % Quiet accretion is a 3D extension of cooling flows
% One of the earliest and most direct comparisons between quiet accretion and stable hot accretion is to \cite{Cowie1980}, who described a one-dimensional cooling flow with terms for angular momentum support included.
% Consistent with our three-dimensional analysis, \citeauthor{Cowie1980} find that gas flows inwards until it reaches a ``stagnation radius'' at which it is angular momentum supported, which results in the gas cooling and becoming denser.
% That the cooling gas subsequently forms a disk is a new result that requires interacting gas (s.t. the gas can gain angular momentum coherence earlier in its history) and three dimensions (s.t. the coherent gas can form a disk when it cools).

% \subsubsection{Precipitation}
% \label{s: modes -- precipitation}

% % What is instability-driven accretion?
% Accretion that occurs due to hydrodynamic instabilities that cause hot halo gas to cool and accrete onto the galaxy is broadly classified as precipitation~\citep[e.g.][]{Sharma2012, Voit2015a, Voit2018, Voit2021}.
% Precipitation may be an important accretion mode because many analytic and simulation analyses suggest hot halo gas may be unstable~\citep[e.g.][]{Balbus1989, Maller2004, McCourt2012, McCourt2016, Joung2012a, Li2014, Armillotta2016, McNamara2016, Schneider2018, Liang2018a, Gronke2019, Gronke2019a, Li2019, Fielding2020}.
% As we discuss in \S\ref{s: broader prevalence -- conditions}, our halos are largely thermally stable, however recent ``enhanced halo resolution'' simulations suggest that cosmological simulations typically under-resolve cool gas in the halo~\citep{VandeVoort2018, Peeples2019a, Hummels2019, Suresh2019}.
% Nevertheless, the gas that condenses out of the halo may not reach the galaxy, as is the case for the gas that does condense in FIRE-2 Milky-Way mass halos~\citep{Esmerian2020}.

% % Relation to the three criteria
% Precipitation, like quiet accretion, is ``hot mode'' accretion: the accreting gas was at one time part of the hot halo~\citep[e.g.][]{Nelson2013}.
% However, precipitation is qualitatively different from quiet accretion.
% First, in quiet accretion hot gas dominates the inflow rate, while in precipitation a significant cold gas mass flow is expected because gas condenses at a variety of radii and remains at $T\sim 10^4$ K until it accretes onto the galaxy.
% Second, we expect precipitating gas to have less coherent angular momentum compared to quiet accretion.
% This is because precipitating gas spends less time hot and therefore has less time to cancel out random angular momentum while hot, and cannot easily exchange angular momentum while cool.
% This suggests precipitation is not as conducive to disk formation~(\S\ref{s: disk formation}).
% Related, a potential diagnostic of quiet accretion vs precipitation may be the geometric distribution of cool gas at the galaxy-halo interface.

% \subsubsection{Cold-flow Streams}
% \label{s: modes -- cold}

% % Relation to three criteria
% The accretion of $T\sim 10^4$ K, filamentary streams from the IGM is thought to dominate the accretion rate at $z\gtrsim 2$ and for lower-mass halos~\citep[e.g.][]{Keres2005, Keres2009, Dekel2006, Oser2010, VanDeVoort2011a}.
% Cold-flow streams are capable of producing the largest cold gas mass inflow rate amongst the different accretion modes, driving rapid galaxy growth.
% The streams are, on-average, aligned with the central galaxy, but with wide variability~\citep[e.g.][]{Danovich2012, Stewart2011a, Stewart2013, Stewart2017}.
% The streams are also not volume-filling, but have covering fractions as little as $\sim 1/2$ that of hot-mode accretion~\citep[e.g.][]{Wright2021}.
% The large scatter in approaching angle and lack of angular momentum exchange between accreting streams suggests that this mode of accretion is not as conducive to disk formation quiet accretion.
% Not, however, that some cold flow streams may form extended messy disks prior to accreting onto the galaxy, and these disks can be torqued to be aligned with the galaxy~\cite{Danovich2012, Danovich2015}.

% % Cold flow streams and angular momentum
% For a number of reasons, cold-flow streams have higher angular momentum than the dark matter halo, and are likely to have higher angular momentum than the hot halo.
% First, cold-flow gas can cross the halo in a shorter period of time, bringing newer accretion with higher angular momentum into the galaxy~\citep[e.g.][]{Stewart2013}.
% Second, filaments are more conducive to being torqued up by gravitational torques~\citep[e.g.][]{Stewart2013, Danovich2015}.
% Finally, for cold-flow streams contribution of pressure torques is negligible compared to gravitational torques at all radii~\citep[e.g.][]{Danovich2015}.

% % Disentangling from other accretion modes
% Cold-flow streams can be more metal poor than other modes of accretion due to the pristine IGM gas they may contain~\citep[e.g.][]{Hafen2019, Wright2021}, although infalling galaxies embedded in filamentary accretion may pre-process and enrich the gas~\citep[e.g.][]{Hafen2019}.
% As such, the metallicity of gas has been considered as a diagnostic for identifying cold-flow streams~\citep[e.g.][]{Hafen2016}.
% Further study is necessary, but it may be possible to use the geometric distribution of cold gas at the galaxy-halo interface in conjunction with the metallicity of the gas to distinguish quiet accretion, precipitation, and cold-flow streams.

% \subsubsection{Satellite Winds and Halos}
% \label{s: modes -- satellite}

% % What is satellite CGM accretion
% The CGM of satellite galaxies are another potent source of fuel for galaxies, in some cases providing up to half the star-forming fuel for $L^*$ galaxies~\citep[intergalactic transfer; ][]{Angles-Alcazar2017}.
% Satellite galaxies themselves typically only account for a small fraction of the fuel provided to galaxies~\citep{Angles-Alcazar2017}. 
% Satellite CGM can account for $\sim1/4$ the mass of $L^*$ CGMs, and can accrete either as part of a cooler gaseous structure or after becoming mixed with the hot halo~\citep{Hafen2019, Hafen2020}.

% % Comparison to three criteria
% Like cold-flows, satellite galaxies are on average co-rotating with the galaxy but with wide variability~\citep[e.g.][]{Stewart2011, Hafen2019}.
% Therefore satellite CGM that isn't ejected and/or stripped and subsequently mixed into the hot halo will provide fuel that is not conducive to disk formation.

% \subsubsection{Recycled Winds}

% \textbf{
% Add some text about winds?
% Or should we focus on modes that provide fresh fuel?

\subsection{Cooling flows versus hydrostatic hot halos}
\label{s: modes -- hydrostatic}

It is important to highlight the differences between the hot halo of a galaxy accreting via a rotating cooling flow and a hydrostatic hot halo.
The hot halos present in $L^*$ FIRE-2 simulation are near, but not in, hydrostatic equilibrium~\citep{Esmerian2020, Stern2020}, and cooling flow solutions in general are close to hydrostatic equilibrium~\citep{Stern2019}.
This makes comparison against hydrostatic models useful for constraining cooling flows, partially because hydrostatic equilibrium models can be fit against a variety of observational constraints~\citep[e.g.][]{Faerman2017, Faerman2019, Krause2019}.
However, rotating cooling flows are different in at least one very important aspect: cooling flows provide accretion onto the galaxy, while hydrostatic gas does not.

\textbf{May not need to say this, considering hydrostatic is so different from what we're talking about, where it's all about inflows.}

\subsection{Rotating cooling flows and SFRs}
\label{s: fueling}

% Maximum accretion rate onto DM halos
% Using previous work we can constrain the rate at which quiet accretion provides fuel for galaxies.
% \cite{Stern2020a} derive and simulate the maximum accretion rate a hot halo can sustain while remaining hot, finding $\dot M_{\rm crit} \approx 0.7 M_\odot/{\rm yr}$ for an $L^*$ halo.
% If the halo accretes gas at a higher rate than $\dot M_{\rm crit}$ then the cooling rate will surpass the free-fall time and the gas will cool and accrete as cold-mode accretion.

% Overprediction of star formation
\textbf{Say: "In our m12s the average SFR is XX, while in observations the observed value is YY. Take observed from behroozi plots.}
The fiducial FIRE simulations may overpredict the median observed SFR in MW-mass halos by a factor of xx, although this is uncertain due to scatter in the SFR at fixed stellar mass and potential underestimation of molecular gas content in the FIRE simulations~\citep{Sparre2017, Orr2018}.
% FIRE simulations also underpredict the number of red galaxies~\citep{Garrison-Kimmel2017}.
Given that in FIRE SFR is regulated by $\Mdot$ (Fig.~2), this potential discrepancy may be a result of an elevated CGM accretion rate relative to the real accretion rate.


The CGM accretion rate may be reduced by including additional feedback to suppress star formation such as cosmic rays~\citep{Chan2019, Hopkins2020, Hopkins2020a, Hopkins2020b}
or AGN feedback (Wellons in prep.(?)). 
% Alternate solution
Our result that the CGM in FIRE forms a cooling flow suggests an alternative solution to this problem, that the CGM mass or metallicity are somewhat overpredicted in MW-mass halos in FIRE.
This follow since in a cooling flow $\Mdot\propto M_{\rm CGM}^2 \Lambda(Z)$, so if say the CGM mass is overpredicted by a factor of two, than $\Mdot$ and the SFR would be overestimated by a factor of four.
Both the CGM mass and metallicity are a result of the integrated enrichment and depletion of the CGM by outflows over cosmic time, and thus are somewhat uncertain. %refer to arXiv:2106.08618
A lower CGM mass than suggested in FIRE would also be more consistent with several studies of X-ray emission from the MW which find $M_{\rm CGM}/0.17M_{\rm halo}=xx$ (Li17, Bregman18), in contrast with $M_{\rm CGM}/0.17M_{\rm halo}=yy$ in FIRE (Hafen+18), though note that other studies deduce $M_{\rm CGM}/0.17M_{\rm halo}=xx$ based on the same X-ray data (Faerman17).
A lower CGM mass in units of the halo baryon budget may also help alleviate the diskrepancy between the $z\sim0$ thin disk fraction predicted by FIRE and observations (El-badry+18a,b,Peebles+19, Stern+20).
This follows since a lower $M_{\rm CGM}$ implies that $t_{\rm cool}$ exceeds $t_{\rm ff}$ and the inner CGM can virialize at lower halo masses (Stern+20b), which given the relation between virialization and thin disk fraction found above would increase the thin disk fraction relative to that predicted by FIRE. 
% The total mass in the CGM at a given time is determined by the full history of the CGM at previous times.
% Even without including additional feedback terms it would be unsurprising if the energy and momentum deposition by wind was inconsistent with real values by an amount necessary to account for this mass difference. \textbf{(Citation needed?)}
% If this is true, one convenient feature is that cooling flow solutions can easily be scaled up/down to predict the properties of the hot CGM in accordance with an appropriate accretion rate.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{s: conclusions}

% Summary paragraph
In this paper we studied the characteristics, prevalence, and mechanics of accretion onto MW-mass disk galaxies at $z \sim 0$.
Our analysis was centered on the history of gas found inside MW-like FIRE-2~\citep{Hopkins2018} simulated galaxies at $z=0$, and outside one Gyr prior.
Our main takeaways are as follows\ldots
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Characteristics (\S\ref{s: characteristics}):}
    Accretion onto $z=0$ $L^*$ disk galaxies is best described by a rotating cooling flow:
    hot/voluminous CGM gas (Figure~\ref{f: Mdot}) that cools at the galaxy-halo interface (Figure~\ref{f: R1e5K}), and as it cools it collapses into a disk oriented with the galaxy (Figure~\ref{f: theta vs t}).
    \item \textbf{Prevalence (\S\ref{s: prevalence}):}
    Rotating cooling flows are the main accretion mechanisms for galaxies forming thin disks and rotating cooling flows are much weaker or absent for galaxies not forming thin disks ---
    across a sample of \Nsample galaxies spanning $10^9 M_\odot < M_\star < 10^11 M_\odot$, the thin disk fraction of stars formed is tightly correlated with the fraction of gas accreted as a rotating cooling flow.
    \item \textbf{Mechanics (\S\ref{s: mechanics}):}
    Quiet accretion occurs when gas proceeds inwards through the CGM while maintaining a voluminous state.
    The gas cools out of the voluminous state when it becomes fully angular-momentum supported, stagnating inward movement, causing an increase in density, and halting compressive heating.
    Prior to cooling its voluminous nature allows the gas to equilibriate to a coherent angular momentum, and therefore when the gas cools it quickly flattens into a shapely disk.
    These mechanics of quiet accretion are summarized in Figure~\ref{f: before and after}.
\end{itemize}

% % Discussion conclusions
% In addition to the characteristics, mechanics, and prevalence, we discussed the following:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Quiet accretion is the expected accretion mode for stable volume-filling infalling gas~(\S\ref{s: broader prevalence}).
%     As such this accretion mode should be especially evident in virialized halos where feedback and cold-flow streams are weak, as is borne out in MW-mass FIRE simulations at z=0.
%     Quiet accretion may also occur in halos affected by feedback in the form of isotropic non-thermal support, provided by e.g. cosmic rays.
%     \item We compare quiet accretion to stable hot accretion, precipitation, cold-flow streams, the accretion of satellite CGMs, and the absence of accretion due to a hydrostatic halo~(\S\ref{s: modes}).
%     Quiet accretion is the only mode where gas has a highly coherent angular momentum prior to accreting.
%     Quiet accretion is also one of the few modes absent a significant inward flux of $T\sim 10^4$ K gas.
%     \item Quiet accretion is constrained by the maximum accretion possible for hot mode accretion, and when the result of a cooling flow the accretion rate is solely a function of the CGM mass and subsequently the cumulative feedback history of a halo~(\S\ref{s: fueling}).
%     \item Quiet accretion is expected to be highly conducive to disk formation because it is "soft-landing", circularized accretion that smoothly cools onto the disk at same rotation speed as the disk.~(\S\ref{s: disk formation}).
%     The onset of quiet accretion is expected when the inner halo virializes, which is correlated with the development of a thin disk in the FIRE simulations.
% \end{itemize}

% Final paragraph
\cite{Trapp2021} find gas infall at the galaxy-halo interface of FIRE-2 $L^*$ galaxies is roughly consistent with observational constraints on mass flux~\citep[e.g.][]{Putman2012, Rohser2016} and cloud infall speed~\citep[e.g.][]{Zheng2017, Werk2019, Bish2019, Ho2020}.
Comprehensive mock observations of may be necessary to provide testable predictions, and to enable identification of galaxies undergoing rotating cooling flows, potentially including our own.
The relationship between rotating cooling flows, disk formation, and a transition in galaxy and CGM properties needs to be further disentangled, with causal directions determined (Gurvich et al., in prep).
To this end, analyses that probe the parameter regime over which quiet accretion occurs in cosmological simulations (including redshift and halo mass) would be valuable.
