% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
We use FIRE simulations to study disk formation in $z\sim 0$, Milky-Way-mass galaxies, and conclude that a key ingredient for the formation of thin stellar disks is the ability for the accreting gas to exchange angular momentum and develop a narrowly-aligned angular momentum distribution prior to joining the galaxy.
Among central galaxies with a high fraction ($>70\%$) of young stars in a thin disk ($h/R \sim 0.1$) we find that:
(i) hot, virial-temperature gas dominates the inflowing gas mass on halo scales ($\gtrsim 20$ kpc), with radiative losses offset by compression heating as the gas moves in toward the central galaxy;
(ii) this hot accretion proceeds until angular momentum support stalls inward motion, at which point the gas cools to $\lesssim10^4\,{\rm K}$ directly onto the galaxy; 
(iii) concurrent with cooling, the accreting gas transitions from a hot quasi-spherical configuration to a cool, flattened, disk-like configuration, with a tightly aligned angular momentum distribution.
We further show that the existence of this ``rotating cooling flow'' accretion mode is strongly correlated with the fraction of thin disk stars in the central galaxy, among a sample of \Nsample\ $z\sim0$ FIRE galaxies spanning a halo mass range of $10^{10.5} M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm h} \lesssim 10^{12} M_\odot$.
Notably, central galaxies with a thick disk or irregular morphology do not show any correspondence between cooling and flattening of accreted gas.
Our results suggest that rotating cooling flows (or, more generally, rotating subsonic flows), which become coherently angular-momentum supported prior to direct deposition onto the galaxy, are likely a necessary condition for the formation of thin, star-forming disk galaxies in a LCDM universe.

% Basic disk formation idea, and its limitations
Our present picture for the formation of galactic disks can be largely traced to analytic ideas first explored by \citet{fall1980}, where a galaxy's angular momentum is intimately tied to the corresponding properties of its host dark matter halo.
Collapsing structures in an otherwise expanding universe will be spun up by the large-scale matter field \citep{Peebles69};
this can deliver enough angular momentum to allow (at least some) galaxies to have significant angular-momentum support~\citep[e.g.][]{MMW98}. 
While these ideas have provided foundational insights into the origin of disk galaxies in a LCDM universe, our understanding of disk  formation, and thin-disk galaxy formation in particular, remains incomplete. 
While dark matter halos of all masses have similar angular momentum distributions \citep[e.g.][]{Barnes87}, disk fraction varies noticeably as a function of galaxy mass \citep[e.g.[]{Bernardi2010,Moffett16}.
Moreover, the detailed properties of disks formed in cosmological simulations cannot be explained by the dark matter spin alone~\citep[e.g.][]{Sales2012, GK18}.  

% The puzzle of thin disks
Given what we know about the angular momentum distribution in galactic halos, it is somewhat surprising that so many galaxies are dominated by {\em thin} disks, with  scale heights and vertical velocity dispersions that are small compared to their scale radii and circular speeds $h/R \sim \sigma_z/V_c \sim 0.1$~\citep[][]{Kregel2002}.
We know, for example, that the angular momentum distribution of dark matter \citep{Bullock2001,Lian2018} and gas \citep{Stewart2013,DeFelippis2020} in galactic halos is quite broad.
This means that in order for a tightly-ordered thin disk to emerge, the gas must become coherently aligned along a single plane \textit{after} being part of the quasi-spherical extended galactic halo and \textit{before} forming stars.
This suggests that the process by which gas is deposited from the galactic halo into the galaxy, and how this process affects the angular momentum distribution, is an essential aspect of thin disk formation.

% Accretion
The process by which gas is deposited into a galaxy from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) has been the subject of considerable exploration~\citep[e.g.][]{Keres2005, Dekel2006, Keres2009, Angles-Alcazar2017, Martin2019a} with broadly two paths to galaxy fueling identified: hot mode and cold mode.
In the cold-mode case, gas is deposited into the galaxy without ever virializing; this occurs typically in lower mass halos, where the gas cooling time is shorter than the infall time.
In hot mode accretion, which dominates for massive halos at late times~\citep[e.g.][]{VandeVoort2011, VandeVoort2012a, Joung2012, Murante2012, Nelson2013}, gas first shock-heats to the halo virial temperature, and then radiates its gravitational and thermal energy prior to accreting onto the galaxy.
Our own Milky Way (MW) is one such galaxy for which hot mode accretion is expected to dominate.
As discussed above, we expect the mode of gas delivery, and the precise means by which gas mixes, cools, and accretes should have a substantial baring on the ability to form thin, coherently rotating disks.  

% Cold mode
In cold mode accretion, cool, $T \sim 10^4$ K cosmological filaments travel into the galaxy from the IGM~\cite[e.g.][]{Keres2005, Dekel2006, Keres2009, Martin2019a}, often along with embedded satellite galaxies~\citep[e.g.][]{Hafen2019, Esmerian2021}.
This mode is expected to dominate the mass inflow rate at high-redshift \citep[$z\gtrsim2$; e.g.][]{Keres2009a, Dekel2009, Huscher2021}.
It is unclear however if the cool filaments remain intact down to the galaxy, or rather heat up and dissolve into the surrounding hot phase~\citep[e.g.][]{Nelson2016, Mandelker2016, Mandelker2018, Mandelker2020a}, in which case hot accretion onto the galaxy would also be important at high redshift.
While cool halo inflow of this kind typically contains more specific angular momentum (in total) than either hot gas or dark matter~\citep{Stewart2017}, the tendency for such gas to reach the galactic region prior to mixing may hinder the ability to develop a thin, coherently aligned structure prior to star formation.
The fact that thin disk galaxies are common only among fairly massive systems $L \sim 0.1 L_\star - L_\star$ at lower redshift~\citep[e.g.][]{Kranz2003, Kassin2006, Bizyaev2021, Kassin2012a, Simons2015, Simons2017}, is roughly consistent with the idea that cold-mode delivery is not conducive to thin disk formation.

% Hot mode
An alternative possibility is that hot mode accretion, believed to dominate in more massive halos at lower redshift, is more favorable to thin-disk formation.
This depends on the specific mechanics of this accretion mode, and on whether the hot gas manages to cool and accrete rather than being reheated by galactic feedback processes.
One possible subset of hot-mode accretion is instability-driven accretion, wherein gas precipitates out of the hot halo due to thermal instabilities, forming cool clouds which lose buoyancy and accrete onto the galaxy~\citep[e.g.][]{Maller2004, Mccourt2012, Voit2015, Armillotta2016, Gronke2020b, Voit2021}.
Alternatively, radiative cooling in the hot CGM can cause the entire hot phase to flow inward.
In this latter scenario, the inward flow occurs at a rate where compression heating of the hot phase roughly balances radiative losses, so the hot gas roughly retains its temperature.
This type of hot accretion has been termed a `cooling flow' in the context of galaxy cluster studies~\citep[][see \citealt{McNamara2007} for a review]{Mathews1978, Cowie1980, Fabian1984, Balbus1988, Bertschinger1989}, and was recently revisited by 
\cite{Stern2019} in the context of galaxy-scale halos.
\cite{Stern2020} then further explored the interplay between angular momentum and thermodynamics in these solutions, using steady-state calculations and idealized hydrodynamic simulations. 
In the present paper we demonstrate that such cooling flows with angular momentum (`rotating cooling flows')
are the primary mode of gas accretion onto disky Milky Way-mass galaxies at $z \sim 0$ in the FIRE cosmological simulations \citep{Hopkins2018}, and may be a necessary condition for the formation of thin star-forming disks.

The analysis here follows \cite{Stern2021}, which showed that the formation of disks in FIRE is closely connected to the formation of a virialized and stable hot CGM.
\cite{Yu2021} subsequently showed that the emergence of an inner virialized CGM in FIRE simulations correlates specifically with a transition from {\em thick}-disk to {\em thin}-disk formation.
The conditions necessary for stars to be born in a well-aligned plane on circular orbits appears to correlate with the conditions necessary for the onset of hot accretion modes such as cooling flows.
This observation partially motivates the exploration that follows.

% Cosmological simulations
Modern cosmological simulations provide a means to understand the characteristics, prevalence, and mechanics of different accretion modes.
These simulations include a combination of cosmological environment and galactic physics, which has allowed simulators to investigate accretion while accounting for both its cosmological nature and its interaction with galaxies and their CGM~\citep[e.g.][]{Oppenheimer2010, Stewart2011, Fernandez2012, Ford2014, Angles-Alcazar2017, Hafen2019, Hafen2020, Ho2019, Rottgers2020, Trapp2021}.
Of special note are ``zoom-in'' simulations that focus on resolving a single halo and its environment, enabling high resolution while preserving cosmological structure~\citep[e.g.][]{Katz1993, Onorbe14, Wang2015, Agertz2021}.
Among these the FIRE simulations~\citep{Hopkins2014, Hopkins2018}\footnote{\url{https://fire.northwestern.edu/}} are a set of zoom-in simulations that resolve stellar feedback on the scale of giant molecular clouds in the ISM, producing winds that naturally expand into the CGM and interact with accreting gas~\citep{Muratov2015, Muratov2017, Hafen2019, Hafen2020}.
The resultant galaxies are broadly consistent with the stellar mass-halo mass relation~\citep{Hopkins2017}, the mass-metallicity relation~\citep{Ma2016a}, satellite galaxy populations~\citep{Wetzel2016, Garrison-Kimmel2019a}, and can have thin-disks consistent with Milky Way-like galaxies~\citep{Ma2017a, Garrison-Kimmel2018, El-Badry2018, Yu2021}.

Here we use the FIRE simulations to study gas accretion onto $z\sim0$ galaxies and its relation to thin disk morphology.
Our approach uses the methodology developed in \citet{Hafen2019, Hafen2020} to  explore the mechanics of rotating cooling flows near the disk-halo interface where angular momentum support is substantial.
This goes beyond 1D steady-state solutions developed in classic ICM studies~\citep[e.g.][]{Cowie1980}, and extends the idealized 3D simulations in \cite{Stern2019} to a more realistic cosmological setting.

Properties at $z=0$ of the sample of FIRE galaxies analyzed in this work.
The value of $f_{\rm thin\,disk,\,recent}$ is the fraction of stars formed in the last Gyr prior to $z=0$ that are in a thin disk configuration ($j/j_c(E) > 0.8$; e.g. \citealt{Yu2021}).
Note that the \texttt{m12m} galaxy has a sizable bar, which forms secularly at late times and drives the thin-disk fraction lower by our adopted definition (marked by $^*$).
The value of $\Delta f_{\rm aligned}$ is a measure of the relation between cooling and circularization in accreted gas (\S\ref{s: characteristics -- aligns}).
The ``hydro+'' simulations include fiducial FIRE physics, while the ``no MD'' simulations exclude a prescription for subgrid metal diffusion.
\end{flushleft}
\label{table: simulations_used}
\end{table*}

% FIRE simulations
We analyze the hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations produced as part of the FIRE project~\citep{Hopkins2014}.
The simulation sample, listed in Table~\ref{table: simulations_used}, were run with the FIRE-2 version~\citep{Hopkins2018} of the gravity and hydrodynamics code \textsc{GIZMO}\footnote{\url{http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/\~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html}}~\citep{Hopkins2015}.
The simulations were produced using the meshless finite-mass (``MFM'') mode of \textsc{GIZMO}, a Lagrangian method with no inter-element mass flux.
This enables use to track the history of each resolution element.
The full details of simulations produced with the FIRE-2 code are available in~\cite{Hopkins2018}.
The FIRE simulations include detailed prescriptions for star formation and stellar feedback.
Each star particle contributes to the simulation momentum from radiation pressure; energy, momentum, mass, and metals from Type Ia and II supernovae and stellar winds; and photo-ionization and photo-electric heating.
Star formation is limited to self-gravitating, molecular, self-shielding gas with a density of at least $n_{\rm SF} = 1000$ cm$^{-3}$.
In the simulations and throughout our analysis we use a standard flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $\Omega_{\rm m }\approx 0.32$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}=1-\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\Omega_{\rm b} \approx 0.049$, and $H_{0} \approx 67$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$~\citep[e.g.,][]{PlanckCollaboration2018}.

% Figure 1
Figure~\ref{f: stars} shows edge-on mock Hubble images (with no dust attenuation) for the $z=0$ snapshots of four of our simulated galaxies.
The top and bottom-left panels show three MW-mass galaxies (\texttt{m12i}, \texttt{m12b}, and \texttt{m12c}) while the bottom-right panel shows a $M_\star \sim 5 \times 10^9 M_\odot$ galaxy, \texttt{m11d}.
As noted in previous studies~\citep{Garrison-Kimmel2018, El-Badry2018} MW-mass galaxies in FIRE typically have thin disk morphologies, while lower mass galaxies show a thick disk / irregular morphology.
We quantify this trend using $f_{\rm thin\,disk,\,recent}$, defined as the fraction of stars with age $<1$ Gyr (at $z=0$) that have $j_z/j_c(E) > 0.8$.
Here $j_z$ is the specific angular momentum in the $z$ direction and $j_c(E)$ is the angular momentum the star would have if it had the same energy but was in a circular orbit.
The $z$ axis is defined as the direction of the total angular momentum vector of stars inside the galaxy.
This definition of the thin disk is the same definition used in~\cite{Yu2021}.
Values of $f_{\rm thin\,disk,\,recent}>0.8$ correspond to height to size ratios $h/R \sim 0.1$ and rotation to dispersion ratios $v_\phi/\sigma\sim10$, and correlate strongly with the observed thin disk fraction in the r band (appendix \ref{s: appendix-sloan thin disk fraction}).
The values of $f_{\rm thin\,disk,\,recent}$ are noted in Fig.~\ref{f: stars} and listed in Table~\ref{table: simulations_used}.

\subsection{Analysis}
\label{s: methods -- analysis}

% How we select the particles
For each galaxy we use the particle tracking method described in \cite{Hafen2019, Hafen2020} to select all resolution elements (particles) that have accreted onto the central galaxy during the last Gyr prior to $z=0$.
To select such particles, we require that they are
(1) within the galaxy radius $r_{\rm gal}$ at $z=0$, either in stars or in gas with density  $n_{\rm H} > 0.13$ cm$^{-3}$, and
(2) within the CGM (gas at $0.1 - 1 \Rvir$) in the snapshot corresponding to 1 Gyr prior to $z=0$.
Throughout the paper we use $r$ for the 3D distance. 
We define $r_{\rm gal} = 4 r_{\star,0.5}$ following \cite{Hafen2019, Hafen2020}.
For each selected particle we retrieve the full history of the particle (including temperature, density, and metallicity). 
We discard a small fraction ($<2\%$) of the particles since over time their mass increases by a factor of over two due to mass deposition by stellar feedback.
These particles pose a problem for our tracking method because the history of the additional mass is not recorded.

% Definition of t1e5 and calculating it
A key time for our analysis is the last time a particle cools prior to entering the galaxy.
For a given particle, we define this time as:
\begin{equation}
    \tcon \equiv t \bigg( {\rm last\,snapshot\,outside\,galaxy\,with\,}T>10^5\,{\rm K} \bigg) ~,
\label{e: tcon}
\end{equation}
i.e., the last snapshot the particle was hot prior to entering the galaxy (according to the galaxy definition above).
For gas that cools as it accretes, $\tcon$ occurs as the gas passes through the galaxy-halo interface.
Below we analyze the statistical properties of all accreting particles as a function of time relative to their cooling time ($t-\tcon$).

% Summary picture description
To characterize gas accretion we analyze the central galaxy and its CGM from $z=0$ to one Gyr prior.
Figure~\ref{f: overview} shows a visual overview of how gas accretes onto \texttt{m12i} -- a MW-mass galaxy that forms a substantial thin disk ($f_{\rm thin\,disk,\,recent} = 0.83$). 
The top and right panels plot the temperature and spatial evolution of accreting gas versus time prior to cooling ($t-\tcon$), while the bottom-left panel plots three representative trajectories for accreting gas elements.
The trajectories were visualized using the Firefly visualization software~\citep{Geller2018}.
\footnote{See the Firefly homepage at \url{galaxies.northwestern. edu/firefly}.
A 3D version of the trajectories is available online at \url{zhafen.github.io/rotating-cooling-flows}.}
Red, white, and blue indicates $T=10^6$ K, $10^5$ K, and $10^4$ K, respectively.
The figure shows that at early times relative to cooling ($t-\tcon \sim -1000$ Myr) the accretion is hot ($\approx10^6$ K) and contracts quasi-spherically.
Then, around the time of cooling the geometry of accreting gas transitions from quasi-spherical at $t - \tcon=-150$ Myr to a cool disk at $t - \tcon=+ 150$ Myr
A quantitative analysis of this transition follows in sections \ref{s: characteristics -- inflowing gas phase}--\ref{s: mechanics -- energy balance}.

\subsection{Gas inflow is hot through the CGM}
\label{s: characteristics -- inflowing gas phase}

Figure~\ref{f: before and after A} plots various characteristics of accreting gas on the \texttt{m12i} thin disk galaxy, as a function of time relative to the accretion's last cooling time ($t - \tcon$).
In each panel solid lines and shaded regions mark the medians and 16th to 84th percentile ranges of all particles accreted within $0.5-1$ Gyr prior to $z=0$.
The lower limit on the time range applied in this figure is to ensure that particles are present for most of the time displayed after $\tcon$.
In the temperature panel (A) we exclude from the distribution particles that have converted into stars. 

Panel (A) demonstrates that during the 500 Myr prior to cooling, the inflow is predominantly hot ($\gtrsim 10^5$ K), with a median temperature of $4-8\times10^5$ K, similar to the halo virial temperature of $\Tvir(z=0)=6.5\times10^5$ K.
During this time prior to cooling the accreting gas is inflowing toward the galaxy (panel B), from a median $r=55$ kpc at $t-\tcon=-500$ Myr, to a median $r\approx18\,{\rm kpc}\approx1.4 r_{\rm gal}$ at $t=\tcon$, after which time the inflow stalls.
The characteristic inflow velocity of $v_r \approx-70$ km s$^{-1}$ (Panel D) is substantially lower than the circular velocity of $170-200$ km s$^{-1}$, indicating significant pressure support in the accreting gas of $1-(v_r/v_c)^2\approx85\%$. This radial velocity is also smaller than the median sound speed of $100-130$ km s$^{-1}$, indicating a subsonic flow. 


A similar hot inflow is seen in other thin disk galaxies in our sample (appendix~\ref{s: appendix-other m12s}).
Thus, accretion from the CGM onto $z=0$ thin disks in FIRE is dominated by the inflow of hot, virial temperature gas.
We show below that this accretion flow corresponds to a `cooling flow', similar to the classical solution envisioned for the ICM (e.g., \citealt{Mathews1978}).
Also, we emphasize that this hot accretion mode, in which the entire hot phase inflows, is qualitatively different from `precipitation' in which gas clumps cool at halo scales, lose buoyancy and subsequently accrete (e.g.~\citealt{Maller2004,Voit2017}). The dominance of hot accretion over precipitation in MW-like galaxies simulated in FIRE has previously been noted by \cite{Esmerian2021}.

\subsection{Accretion cools and stalls at the galaxy-halo interface}
\label{s: characteristics -- cools}

Panel (A) in Fig.~\ref{f: before and after A} demonstrates that at $t = \tcon$ the temperature drops quickly from $\sim10^6$ K to $\sim10^4$ K.
Panel (B) shows that this cooling occurs just outside the galaxy, at $r(\tcon) \approx 10-30$ kpc, equivalent to $\approx0.7 - 2.5 r_{\rm gal}$\footnote{Note that gas can have $r(\tcon) < r_{\rm gal}$ if it is under-dense relative to the galaxy when it crosses $r_{\rm gal}$ ($n_{\rm H} < 0.13$ cm$^{-3}$), see section \ref{s: methods -- analysis}.}.
Less than $10\%$ of particles cool beyond $\sim 40$ kpc.
At this point, the temperature further drops to ISM temperatures of $100-10^4$ K and stars start to form at a rate of $\approx10\%$ per $100$ Myr (panel E), roughly equal to the average rate in the galaxy ISM. 

Panel (D) in Fig.~\ref{f: before and after A} demonstrates that cooling at the galaxy scale is further associated with a change in accretion kinematics.
The radial inflow velocity $\vert v_r \vert $ starts decelerating $\approx40$ Myr prior to cooling, and almost completely stalls ($\lesssim10$ km s$^{-1}$) after cooling.
This stalling is associated with $v_\phi$ reaching $v_c$, indicating a transition from pressure-support in the hot CGM to rotational support in the cool ISM.
Note that deceleration prior to accretion is possible due to the subsonic nature of the hot flow.
Similar results are seen for accretion onto other thin-disk galaxies in our sample (appendix \ref{s: appendix-other m12s}). 
Specifically, the majority of accretion onto $z\sim0$ thin disk galaxies in FIRE is a hot inflow which cools and stalls just outside the galaxy.
This is {\em not} the case for galaxies that lack thin disks in our sample (appendix \ref{s: appendix-low mass}).
Galaxies that are dominated by thick/irregular morphology demonstrate no such stalling behavior.

    }
    \label{f: theta vs t}
\end{figure*}

% Figure description/introduction
Panel (C) in Fig.~\ref{f: before and after A} plots the distance $z$ above the disk plane as a function of time.
We see that as the gas collapses, it becomes increasingly flattened in the disk plane.
The horizontal line shows $r_{\rm gal}$ for reference.
At the time of cooling, the gas has median height of $\approx 2$ kpc, indicating a disk geometry with height to radius ratio of $\vert z\vert/r_{\rm gal}\approx0.2$, consistent with the transition to rotation support indicated by panel (D).
Panel (E) in Fig.~\ref{f: before and after A} emphasizes that all of the star formation occurs after rotation support is achieved and the disk geometry is in place.

This correspondence between a transition to disk geometry and cooling is further explored in Figure~\ref{f: theta vs t}, which plots the geometry of accreting gas at different times relative to $\tcon$, for the four galaxies shown in Fig.~\ref{f: stars}. 
Times prior to cooling are colored in red, while times after cooling are plotted in blue.
All particles with $t-\tcon$ within $\pm$30 Myr of the value noted in the legend are included in the distribution. 
The curves show the PDF of $\cos \theta = z/r$, i.e.\ $\theta$ is the angle between the gas element position and the total angular momentum vector of stars in the galaxy.
A spherical distribution of accreted gas would have a flat PDF with a value of 0.5, while 
the PDF of an infinitely thin disk would be a $\delta$-function centered at $z/r = 0$.
The figure shows that gas accreting onto the three thin disk galaxies transitions from being distributed quasi-spherically at $t = \tcon-200$ Myr to being distributed in the galaxy plane at $t = \tcon+200$ Myr.
This indicates that cooling and flattening of the accreted gas occurs simultaneously in these galaxies, consistent with the conclusion from Figs.~\ref{f: overview} and \ref{f: before and after A}.
In contrast, in the irregular galaxy shown in the bottom-right, there is no association between cooling and flattening.
Rather, the geometry of accreting gas is quasi-spherical both before and after cooling.

    \label{f: prevalence}
\end{figure*}


% Figure description
Figure~\ref{f: prevalence} extends the analysis in Fig.~\ref{f: theta vs t} to the full sample.
We parametrize the extent to which flattening and cooling are concurrent via a parameter $f_{\rm aligned}$ (spatial aligned accretion), which corresponds to the fraction of accreting gas mass aligned with the disk plane ($\vert z/R \vert < 0.1$, marked by dashed vertical lines in Fig.~\ref{f: theta vs t}).
This range of angles contains $\approx 60\%$ of stars in thin disks ~\footnote{by `thin disk' we mean stars with $j_z/j_c > 0.8$}.
The left panel of Fig.~\ref{f: prevalence} shows the evolution of $f_{\rm aligned}$ from 200 Myr before $\tcon$ (red) to 200 Myr after $\tcon$ (blue), while the right panel shows the difference in $f_{\rm aligned}$ between these two epochs.
The horizontal axes plot the fraction of young stars in a thin disk $f_{\rm thin\,disk,\,recent}$. 
For most halos the accreting gas is largely unaligned prior to cooling, with aligned mass fractions $f_{\rm aligned}\sim 0.1 - 0.2$ comparable to $f_{\rm aligned} = 0.1$ expected for an isotropic distribution.
Upon cooling, the alignment of accreting gas sharply increases in halos with $f_{\rm thin\,disk,\,recent} > 0.5$ --- in most cases $\gtrsim 50\%$ of mass collapses to $\vert z/R \vert < 0.1$ during this time.
In contrast, in halos with $f_{\rm thin\,disk,\,recent} \approx 0$ there is practically no change in $f_{\rm aligned}$ upon cooling.
Intermediate cases with $f_{\rm thin\,disk,\,recent} \approx 0.2-0.4$ typically show a modest increase in $f_{\rm aligned}$ and are further discussed in appendix~\ref{s: appendix-individual}.
The right panel of Fig.~\ref{f: prevalence} demonstrates the strong correlation between the change in $f_{\rm aligned}$ when the gas cools and the fraction of young stars in a thin disk. The halo circled in the right panel, \texttt{m12m}, is of special note:
gas accretes onto the halo as a rotating cooling flow, but subsequent evolution in the ISM and/or stellar population produces a stellar bar.
Fig.~\ref{f: prevalence} thus demonstrates, for our entire FIRE sample, that circularization is concurrent with cooling in accretion onto thin-disk galaxies, while no such association exists for accretion onto irregular / thick disk galaxies.

\subsection{Angular momentum coherence in accreted gas}
\label{s: mechanics -- coherence}

% Figure coherence description
Figure~\ref{f: coherence} shows the cumulative distribution function of $j_z / \vert \vec j \vert$ in the accreted gas, weighted by mass, for the four simulations shown in Figure~\ref{f: theta vs t}.
This distribution quantifies the level of alignment of angular momentum in the accreted gas with respect to the rotation axis of the stars.
For reference, perfectly co-rotating gas has $j_z / \vert \vec j \vert = 1$, while perpendicular and counter-rotating gas have $j_z / \vert \vec j \vert = 0$ and $-1$, respectively.
An isotropic distribution of angular momentum would appear as a diagonal line in this plot. 
Each curve corresponds to a different range of $t - \tcon$ as noted in the legend. 
Outlined in black are the CDFs for the three times plotted in Fig.~\ref{f: prevalence}: $t - \tcon =$ -200, 0, 200 Myr.

% Overall evolution
In gas accreting onto thin disk galaxies (top and bottom-left panels of Fig.~\ref{f: coherence})  the angular momentum distribution becomes increasingly coherent with time relative to $\tcon$.
At $t-\tcon=-1$ Gyr the angular momentum distribution is marginally coherent, with only $\approx50\%$ of accreting gas co-rotating, with $j_z/\vert \vec j \vert > 0.5$.
In contrast at $t-\tcon=+500$ Myr the distribution is highly coherent, with $j_z/\vert \vec j \vert > 0.9$ for $\gtrsim 90\%$ of accretion.
The majority of the evolution in coherence occurs over $\lesssim 400$ Myr centered on $\tcon$, as seen by the differences between the outlined CDFs.
This increase in coherence allows the accreting gas to collapse into a thin disk as shown in Figs.~\ref{f: theta vs t}--\ref{f: prevalence}.
Furthermore, this result shows that accreting gas is almost entirely co-rotating with the galaxy {\em prior} to cooling, i.e., while the accretion is still part of the galactic `hot corona'. 
Close comparison with Fig.~\ref{f: theta vs t} shows that angular momentum coherence is achieved just prior to spatial flattening. 

In stark contrast with thin disk galaxies, the irregular galaxy \texttt{m11d} shown in the bottom-right panel of Fig.~\ref{f: coherence} experiences only a very mild evolution in angular momentum coherence --- angular momentum remains only marginally co-rotating both before and after cooling.

% Ang Momentum Prevalence
In Fig.~\ref{f: prevalence - angular momentum} we show the evolution of angular momentum alignment across the full sample, as Fig.~\ref{f: prevalence} did for spatial alignment. 
In this case, spin alignment is defined as the fraction of gas with $j_z/j > 0.9$.
As was the case for spatial alignment, a greater increase in spin alignment during cooling correlates with a greater thin disk presence.

% Coherence
The evolution of angular momentum in accretion onto thin disks is further explored in Figure~\ref{f: before and after B}, for the example case of \texttt{m12i}.
Panel (A) shows the median and 16th-84th percentiles in $j_z/\vert\vec j\vert$ for individual particles as a function of $t-\tcon$.
The dashed line plots this ratio for the {\em sum} of all particles at a given $t-\tcon$; the closer the dashed line and shaded region are, the more coherent the spin.
Note that the ratio of the total $j_z/\vert j \vert$ is not identically equal to unity because the $z$ direction is with respect to the central galaxy and {\em not} the gas itself.
Consistent with Fig.~\ref{f: coherence}, at $t-\tcon=-500$ Myr the ratio $j_z/\vert\vec j\vert$ spans a large range of $\approx -0.3 - 0.9$, while by $\tcon$ nearly all the accreting gas has $j_z\approx\vert\vec j\vert$, indicating all hot accreting gas particles are co-rotating.
On the other hand, the ratio $j_z/\vert\vec j\vert$ of the total angular momentum vector is nearly constant with time prior to accretion. 
These trends indicate that components unaligned with the net angular momentum are canceling out due to interaction in the hot halo.

% Support
Figure~\ref{f: before and after B} panel (B) shows the magnitude of the specific angular momentum ($\vert \vec j \vert$; green) and the z-component of the specific angular momentum ($j_z$; purple).
The median value $\vert \vec j \vert$ decreases prior to cooling, from $\approx 5000$ kpc km s$^{-1}$ to $\approx 3000\,{\rm kpc\,km\,s}^{-1}$, in contrast with  $j_z$ which remains constant.
The nearly constant $j_{\rm z}$ indicates the inflow conserves angular momentum in this direction, and is not subject to significant torques. 
The value of $j_z\approx 2500$ kpc km s$^{-1}$ is comparable to the average specific angular momentum of $j_{\rm DM} \simeq \sqrt{2}\lambda \Rvir \vvir$ expected in dark matter halos due to tidal torques \citep[e.g.][]{Bullock2001}.
Using a typical dimensionless spin parameter $\lambda \simeq 0.035$, and the virial radius $\Rvir=270$ kpc and virial velocity $\vvir=130$ km s$^{-1}$ of this halo, we get $j_{\rm DM}\approx1750$ kpc km s$^{-1}$, i.e.~the expected average value of the dark matter is within $30\%$ of the net angular momentum of accreting hot gas shown in Fig.~\ref{f: before and after B}.~\footnote{The fact that the gas has slightly more angular momentum than naively expected for the dark matter is consistent with previous findings that gas typically has a slightly higher spin than dark matter \citep[e.g.][]{Stewart2017}.}

The dashed line in panel (B) of Fig.~\ref{f: before and after B} plots the specific angular momentum necessary for gas to be fully supported by angular momentum at a given radius, i.e. $v_c(r)r$, where we use the median $r$ at the relevant $t-\tcon$ for this calculation.
The accretion attains significant angular momentum support as it proceeds through the inner CGM, consistent with other analyses of CGM rotational support~\citep{Oppenheimer2018}.
The values of $j_z$ and $v_c(r)r$ converge shortly after $t=\tcon$, indicating that cooling and a transition to rotational support occur almost simultaneously, as indicated also by Fig.~\ref{f: before and after A}.
This result is consistent with 1D steady-state cooling flow solutions which include angular momentum.
These solutions demonstrate that the hot inflow cools to $\sim10^4$ K at the radius where $j_z=r v_c(r)$, as long as the flow remains subsonic down to this radius \citep{Cowie1980, Stern2019}.

% The angular momentum increase
There is small-but-noticeable increase in $j_z$ at $t \approx \tcon$.
This increase is not the focus of our analysis, but we note that it may be a result of a difference in orientation and/or amplitude between the angular momentum of the galaxy and the angular momentum of the accreting gas~\citep[e.g.][]{Danovich2012, DeFelippis2017}, which forces the accreting gas to co-rotate with the galaxy.
The explicit mechanism to increase $j_z$ may be exchange of angular momentum via gravitational torques~\citep[e.g.][]{Danovich2015} or via collisional interactions.
Any angular momentum gained is expected to be lost by other particles, driving inflow of existing gas particles in the galaxy or galaxy-halo interface~\citep[e.g.][]{Mayor1981, Pezzulli2017}.
We note that the median increase in $j_z$ upon accretion and cooling shown in Fig.~\ref{f: before and after B} is quantitatively consistent with the observed $30\%$ difference between the rotation velocity of the the Milky Way disk and its hot CGM \citep{Hodges-Kluck2016}.

\subsection{Energetics of accreting gas}
\label{s: mechanics -- energy balance}

% Density
Figure~\ref{f: before and after B} panel (C) shows the distribution of the accreting gas number density  versus time relative to cooling.
Prior to cooling the gas density increases steadily due to the inflow, reaching $\approx10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$ just before cooling at $t\lesssim\tcon$.
This density is comparable to observational estimates of the hot gas density just outside the Milky Way disk (e.g.,~\citealt{Li2017a}).
At $t\approx\tcon$, the gas density sharply increases, reaching $0.1$ cm$^{-3}$ within $\approx50$ Myr, due to the deceleration induced by the stalling of the inflow upon accretion (Fig.~\ref{f: before and after A}), and due to the collapse from a quasi-spherical geometry into a disk geometry. 

% Energy balance description
In Figure~\ref{f: before and after B} panel (D) we assess the energetics of the gas to determine why it cools.
We study the energetics through two types of change in specific energy: radiative cooling (blue lines) and compression heating (red lines).
Radiative cooling per unit mass for an individual particle is calculated as $\nH^2 \Lambda / \rho$, where $\nH$ is the Hydrogen density, $\rho$ is the mass density, and $\Lambda$ is the cooling function, which we take from \cite{Wiersma2009a}.
Compressive heating per unit mass for an individual particle is calculated as $P \frac{dV}{dt} \approx \frac{ P }{ \rho^2 } \frac{ \Delta \rho }{ \Delta t }$, where $P = n k_B T$, $\Delta \rho$ is the change in density from one snapshot to the next, and $\Delta t$ is the snapshot time spacing.
Because accreting gas elements interact with other accreting gas elements thermodynamically we show the mean specific energy tracks of all gas elements binned into 100 Myr bins of $\tcon$.
To focus on the behavior of the majority of the particles we do not bin the $1\%$ of particles with the highest change in specific energy.
Some $\tcon$ bins contain much more accreting gas than others, and to reflect this we set the darkness of the lines proportional to the number of particles in the bin.

% Energy balance trend
At $t-\tcon=-500$ Myr the radiative cooling rate is $\approx0.006$ erg s$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$, corresponding to a cooling time of $400$ Myr for the median temperature of $T=4\times 10^5$ K at this epoch (see Fig.~\ref{f: before and after A}, panel A).
At $t-\tcon =-500$ Myr the cooling time is thus comparable to the accretion time of $\approx500$ Myr.
At later $t-\tcon$ but still prior to cooling, the radiative cooling rate increases due to the increase in gas density.
The panel however shows that this energy loss to radiation  is nearly completely offset by compressive heating, explaining the roughly flat temperature profile at $t<\tcon$ (Fig.~\ref{f: before and after A}). 
These equalities between the cooling time and the accretion time, and between radiative cooling and compressive heating, are defining characteristics of classic cooling flows in which angular momentum support can be neglected \citep{Mathews1978, McNamara2007, Stern2019}. 

Around $\tcon$ the cooling rate and compressive heating diverge.
This can be understood by noting that the radiative cooling rate per unit mass scales as $\propto\rho\Lambda$, while the compressive heating rate scales as $\propto\epsilon d\log\rho/d t$ where $\epsilon$ is the specific thermal energy.
The deceleration of the hot inflow prior to accretion onto the galaxy causes $\rho$ to increase faster than $d\log\rho/d t$, causing the temperature to decrease.
This in turn increases $\Lambda$ and decreases $\epsilon$, which further accelerates the drop in temperature.
The result is gas that cools from $\approx10^6$ K to $\approx10^4$ K over the course of $\lesssim 50$ Myr.

\section{Discussion}
\label{s: discussion}

In this paper we analyze the properties of gas accreting onto $z\sim0$ galaxies simulated in FIRE, focusing on Milky-Way mass galaxies in which new stars form in a thin disk. 
We find that thin disk galaxies in FIRE accrete via `rotating cooling flows', a mode of `hot accretion' in which the quasi-spherical $T\sim\Tvir$ CGM phase inflows towards the galaxy, remaining hot down to the radius where its angular momentum is sufficient to provide rotational support.
At this radius ($\gtrsim 4 R_{1/2}$, just outside the galaxy radius) the hot inflow both decelerates and becomes coherently rotating, and then simultaneously cools and collapses into a rotating cool disk.
Our results thus extend classic cooling flow theory by demonstrating their applicability in realistic cosmological simulations, and by exploring the mechanics of cooling flows with angular momentum, a subject which has not yet been studied extensively~\citep[c.f.][]{Cowie1980, Stern2019}.
Moreover, we find a strong correlation between the prevalence of this accretion mode and the fraction of stars in the central galaxies that form in a thin disk, potentially indicating that a rotating cooling flow is a necessary condition for the formation of a thin star-forming disk.
In this section we discuss several interpretations, caveats, and implications of our results. 

\subsection{Why are rotating cooling flows conducive to thin disk formation?}
\label{s: why CFs thin disks}

Our analysis identifies two properties of rotating cooling flows that likely promote the formation of thin star forming disks in the central galaxy.
These include the tendency of rotating cooling flows to become coherently rotating prior to cooling and accretion onto the galaxy (Fig.~\ref{f: coherence} and panels A--B in Fig.~\ref{f: before and after B}),
and their tendency to decelerate before accretion (panel D in Fig.~\ref{f: before and after A}).
Combined, these two properties indicate that upon cooling the accretion flow forms a thin disk with $v_\phi\approx v_{\rm c}$ and $v_r, v_\theta \ll v_{\rm c}$. 
Though any accreting collisional medium is expected to eventually equilibriate into such a coherently rotating disk, in rotating cooling flows this coherence is achieved \textit{prior} to cooling and accretion onto the ISM.
This both implies that the accretion process does not stir turbulence in the ISM (in contrast with cold flows as discussed in \citealt{Dekel2009}), and that star formation commences only after the accreting gas forms a thin gaseous disk morphology (Fig.~\ref{f: before and after A}).
In contrast, in other accretion modes some stars may succeed in forming while the accreting gas morphology is still a thick disk or irregular.
Such stars will inject feedback momentum and energy into their surroundings which could further delay the equilibration process, allowing even more stars to form outside of a thin disk. 

Why do hot inflows decelerate and rotate coherently prior to accretion?
We argue here that these characteristics are a result of the subsonic nature of the flow, though defer a formal derivation to future work. 
In a subsonic flow gradual deceleration prior to accretion is expected since the inflow is `forewarned' (via changes in pressure) of the transition to rotational support at the galaxy scale.
This is in contrast with supersonic accretion modes where the accreting gas is expected to shock and halt abruptly at the galaxy scale.
The subsonic nature of hot inflows may also induce the angular momentum coherence achieved near the rotational support radius (Fig.~\ref{f: before and after B}, panel A).
This follows since  at the rotational support radius the mean rotational velocity $\langle v_\phi \rangle$ equals the circular velocity $v_{\rm c}$ (by definition), while $v_{\rm c}^2\approx c_{\rm s}^2$ in hot flows where $c_{\rm s}$ is the sound speed.
Thus, the mean Mach number in the $\phi$ direction approaches unity at the rotational support radius, and any velocity fluctuations around this mean would lead to speeds which approach or exceed the sound speed.
Since such supersonic fluctuations will rapidly shock and convert their kinetic energy into thermal energy, we expect any velocity fluctuations induced by a broad distribution of angular momentum to rapidly die out when the hot flow approaches the rotational support radius, yielding a coherent accretion flow.

The scenario suggested by this paper, that thin star forming disks are a result of accretion via rotating cooling flows, allows us to predict at which halo masses and redshifts we expect thin disks to form.
Cooling flows are expected only following the formation of a time-steady and pressure-supported `virialized CGM', which occurs when the cooling time of hot shocked CGM gas $\tcoolsh$ exceeds the free-fall time $\tff$ at halo masses above a threshold of $\sim10^{11}-10^{12}\msun$ \citep{White1978, White1991, Birnboim2003}. 
Even in the presence of such a virialized CGM, cooling flows may be subdominant to cold flows that penetrate the hot halo, especially at $z>1$ \cite[e.g.,][]{Keres2005,Dekel2006, Dekel2009}, or could be disrupted by heating from feedback as envisioned in `thermal-balance'  models of the CGM \citep[e.g.,][]{Mccourt2012, Sharma2012, Voit2017, Faerman2017, Faerman2020}.
Furthermore, \cite{Stern2019} demonstrated that even if a virialized CGM exists in the outer halo and heating by feedback can be neglected, the resulting cooling flow may go through a sonic point and reach the galaxy as cool supersonic accretion.
Thus, to produce cooling flows which remain hot and subsonic down to the galaxy scale as found above for thin disk galaxies, a more specific condition should be satisfied, namely that $\tcoolsh$ exceeds $\tff$ at an inner CGM radius of $\approx0.1 r_{\rm vir}$.
In FIRE, this latter condition is met and the inner CGM indeed virializes at $\Mvir\approx10^{12}\msun$, roughly independent of redshift (\citealt{Stern2021}).

Figure~\ref{f: prevalence vs galaxy properties} shows the relationship between thin disk fraction and virial mass (left panel), stellar mass (middle), and $\tcoolsh/\tff$ at $0.1 r_{\rm vir}$ (right panel), in our sample of $z\sim0$ FIRE galaxies.
Markers are colored by $\Delta f_{\rm aligned}$, a measure of the dominance of rotating cooling flows in accreting gas (Fig.~\ref{f: prevalence}).
The figure shows that thin disks and rotating cooling flows appear at $M_{\rm vir}\approx 10^{12}\msun$ and $\tcoolsh/\tff(0.1\Rvir)>1$, consistent with the expectation noted above that cooling flows and hence thin disks commence only when the inner CGM virializes.
This mass scale for thin disk formation is however larger than in $z\sim0$ observations, as further discussed in the next section.

% Necessary but not sufficient
We note that accretion via a rotating cooling flow does not ensure a thin disk forms. 
A merger, strong feedback event, or other disruption may take a thin gaseous disk and disturb it, preventing stars from forming in a thin disk.
Simulation \texttt{m12m} provides evidence of this:
it has rotating cooling flow accretion comparable to thin disk galaxies ($\Delta f_{\rm aligned} \approx 0.25$), but has a relatively small $f_{\rm thin\,disk,\,recent} \approx 0.4$ (yellow square in Fig.~\ref{f: prevalence}).
However, the strong correlation seen in Fig.~\ref{f: prevalence} between the prevalence of rotating cooling flow accretion (quantified via $\Delta f_{\rm aligned}$) and the thin disk fraction $f_{\rm thin\,disk,\,recent}$ suggests that such events are relatively rare. 


The result in Fig.~\ref{f: prevalence vs galaxy properties} that cooling flows occur when $\tcoolsh>\tff$ at $0.1\Rvir$ and the inner CGM virializes indicates that any heating of the CGM by stellar feedback in FIRE is insufficient to disrupt the cooling flow.
This is consistent with the weak outflows at this mass and redshift scale in the FIRE simulations \citep{Muratov2015, Muratov2017, Stern2021, Pandya2021} and in observations \citep[e.g.,][]{Heckman2019}.
The potential effects of AGN feedback, not implemented in the FIRE sample used in this work, are further discussed in \S~\ref{s: caveats}. 

How does thin disk formation depend on redshift?
While the threshold of inner CGM virialization is roughly independent of redshift, the importance of cold flows penetrating the hot halo does is expected to be redshift-dependent, and thus if thin disks form as a result of hot accretion we expect them to be rarer at high redshift.
This expectation is realized in FIRE, where disks that form following virialization at $z\gtrsim2$ tend to be thicker ($V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_z\approx2-3$, see fig.~14 in \citealt{Stern2021}) than their low-redshift counterparts discussed in this work ($V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_z\approx7-10$).
This trend is also qualitatively consistent with other simulations which show relatively thick disks at high redshift (e.g.,~\citealt{Pillepich2019, Dekel2019}) and with the thicker disks seen in high-redshift observations~\citep[e.g.][]{Tadaki2017}.

We note that while the thickness of massive disks and the dominance of cooling flows in FIRE appear to depend on redshift, other transitions  associated with inner CGM virialization appear to be redshift-independent.
These include the suppression of stellar-driven outflows on CGM scales and the transition from rapidly fluctuating (`bursty') star formation to time-steady star formation (\citealt{Stern2021, Yu2021}, Gurvich et al., in prep).
These transitions may hence be tied more directly to a different effect of inner CGM virialization, such as the confinement of outflows (see \citealt{Stern2021}). 

\subsection{Analogous accretion in cosmic ray-dominated halos}
\label{s: crs}

In Fig.~\ref{f: before and after m12i cr} in the appendix we plot the properties of accreting gas in a simulation which includes cosmic ray physics ~\citep[][]{Chan2019, Hopkins2020a}, thus providing a window into the differences in gas accretion modes in simulations with non-thermal support.
The accretion onto the central galaxy in this simulation (\texttt{m12i\_cr}) is similar to rotating cooling flows in many aspects:
accreting gas gains coherence in the halo, becomes rotationally supported at the galaxy edge (with a decreased radial velocity), and subsequently collapses into a disk.
These properties were highlighted also by \cite{Trapp2021}, who performed a phenomenological-focused analysis on the accretion of gas onto MW-mass disk galaxies with CR-dominated halos.
However, panels A and I of Fig.~\ref{f: before and after m12i cr} demonstrates that accreting gas in CR-dominated never shocks to a temperature $T \sim T_{\rm vir} \sim 10^{5.5}$ K and the radiative cooling is not offset by compression heating, i.e. the accretion is not a cooling flow.
This is because \texttt{m12i\_cr} is dominated not by thermal pressure, but by cosmic ray (CR) pressure that provides support against gravity without significantly heating the gas~\citep{Ji2020}.

% Mechanics
Increased coherence and decreased radial velocity prior to accretion, the two properties of rotating cooling flows we identify as promoting thin disk formation (\S\ref{s: why CFs thin disks}), are clearly present in \texttt{m12i\_cr} (Fig.~\ref{f: before and after m12i cr}).
Consistent with this, \texttt{m12i\_cr} has a high thin disk fraction, $f_{\rm thin\,disk,\,recent}=0.71$.
In \S\ref{s: why CFs thin disks} we argue that the coherent co-rotation and deceleration of rotating cooling flows is a result of its subsonic nature.
Consistent with this, the accreting gas in the CR-dominated halo is also effectively subsonic, wherein 
gas elements interact via CR pressure rather than thermal pressure. 
The qualitatively similar behavior between both rotating cooling flows and accretion in CR-dominated halos suggests these accretion modes are a subset of a more general form of \textit{disk-conducive subsonic accretion}.

\subsection{Caveats}
\label{s: caveats}

% Overprediction of star formation
In our MW-mass halos the average SFR over $z=0-0.5$ is SFR$\approx 3-10\,M_\odot/$yr, while the observationally-based average SFR for $M_{\rm vir} \sim 10^{12} M_\odot$ halos over the same redshift range is SFR$\approx 0.7-6\,M_\odot/$yr~\citep{Behroozi2013}.
Since the SFR is expected to be regulated by the CGM accretion rate $\Mdot_{\rm CGM}$, this potential discrepancy may be a result of an elevated  $\Mdot_{\rm CGM}$ relative to the real accretion rate.

The CGM accretion rate may be reduced if the cooling flow is disrupted by additional physics implemented in separate suites of FIRE simulations, including cosmic rays~\citep{Chan2019, Hopkins2020a, Hopkins2021e, Hopkins2021d} and AGN feedback (Wellons et al. in prep.).
It is however unclear whether either of these processes can disrupt the cooling flow in the CGM, given the uncertainties in the assumed CR transport model which is uncertain especially in the CGM \citep{Hopkins2021, Quataert2021, Quataert2021a}, and given that it is uncertain whether the coupling between AGN feedback and the CGM is sufficiently high.
Moreover, if AGN feedback is intermittent, a rotating cooling flow is expected to reform quickly when AGN feedback is off, roughly on a cooling timescale which is $\approx100$ Myr in the inner CGM. 

An alternative solution to the elevated accretion rate problem is that the cooling flow is not disrupted, but just weaker than in FIRE since the CGM mass or metallicity are overpredicted in FIRE at $z\sim0$.
This follows since in a cooling flow $\Mdot_{\rm CGM}\propto M_{\rm CGM}^2 \Lambda(Z)$, where $M_{\rm CGM}$ is the CGM mass and $\Lambda$ is the cooling function.
Thus, if the CGM mass is overpredicted by a factor of two then $\Mdot$ and the SFR would be overestimated by a factor of four.
Both the CGM mass and metallicity are a result of the integrated enrichment and depletion of the CGM by outflows over cosmic time, and thus are uncertain~\citep[e.g.,][]{Davies2021, Kelly2021}.
A lower CGM mass than found in FIRE would also be more consistent with several studies of X-ray emission from the MW which find $M_{\rm CGM}/f_bM_{\rm vir} \approx 0.1$~\citep[][]{Li2018, Bregman2018}, where $f_b M_{\rm halo}$ is the cosmological baryon fraction multiplied by the halo mass.
This is in contrast with $M_{\rm CGM}/f_bM_{\rm vir} \approx 0.2-0.4$ for similar-mass FIRE halos~\citep{Hafen2019}, though note that other studies deduce $M_{\rm CGM}/f_bM_{\rm halo}=0.3$ based on the same X-ray data~\citep{Faerman2020}.

A lower CGM mass in units of the halo baryon budget may also help alleviate the discrepancy between $z\sim0$ FIRE galaxies in which a rotation-dominated disk appears only above $M_\star\sim10^{10}\msun$, in contrast with observations which find rotation-dominated
disks above $M_\star\sim10^9\msun$ (\citealt{El-Badry2018a, El-Badry2018}, see also \citealt{Peebles2020}).
This follows since a lower $M_{\rm CGM}$ both implies a lower SFR and hence lower $M_\star$ for a given halo mass, and a lower halo mass threshold for inner CGM virialization, since $\tcoolsh$ is larger when $M_{\rm CGM}$ is lower. 
The latter effect would cause the onset of cooling flows and the formation of thin disks to occur at lower halo masses than suggested by Fig.~\ref{f: prevalence vs galaxy properties}.
\cite{Stern2021} showed that at $z\sim0$ a factor of a few increase in $\tcoolsh$ relative to that in FIRE would decrease the threshold halo mass in which the inner CGM virializes to $M_{\rm vir}\sim10^{11}\msun$, corresponding to a threshold stellar mass of $M_\star\sim10^9\msun$ for thin disk formation.

\subsection{Comparison to observations}

\cite{Hodges-Kluck2016} analyzed the velocity shifts of O{\sc VII} absorption lines originating in the Milky-Way halo, observed with XMM-Newton towards an ensemble of AGN. 
They deduced that the hot inner CGM of the Milky Way (or `Galactic corona') is rotating at $180\pm40$ km s$^{-1}$, corresponding to $60-90\%$ of the rotation velocity of the disk.
This result is consistent with a rotating cooling flow, in which the hot CGM spins up as it flows inward, and achieves a significant rotational speed just outside the galaxy (Fig.~\ref{f: before and after A}).
It would thus be useful to make quantitative predictions for X-ray absorption and emission line observations in the halos of the Milky-Way and nearby massive disks, assuming they are fed by rotating cooling flows as found above in FIRE.
Comparing these predictions with existing and future observations \citep[e.g. with Lynx,][]{TheLynxTeam2018} will allow to test whether local massive disks are indeed fed by rotating cooling flows. 

While cool gas in the CGM is more accessible to observations than the hot CGM, in rotating cooling flows the accreting gas becomes cool only when it has no significant spatial or kinematic offset from the galaxy, and would thus be challenging to detect beyond $z\sim0$.
Rotating cooling flows thus constitute a type of `quiet accretion'~\citep{Putman2012}. 
Consistent with quiet accretion, \cite{Sancisi2008} and \cite{Binney2009} argue that the accretion implied by cool gas observed in the halos of massive disks is insufficient to sustain star formation.
We defer to future work making predictions for hot gas cooling just outside the galaxy and comparing with observations of the Milky-Way and nearby disks \citep[e.g.,][]{Zheng2017}. 

\section{Summary}
\label{s: conclusions}

% Summary paragraph
In this paper we use the particle-tracking method developed in \cite{Hafen2019,Hafen2020} to study how gas accretes onto $z\sim0$ galaxies in the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom simulations~\citep{Hopkins2018}, focusing on Milky-Way mass galaxies in which stars form in a thin disk. 
Our main results are as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Mechanics of rotating cooling flows:}
    We find that gas accretion onto thin disk galaxies in FIRE is dominated by rotating cooling flows, wherein the hot $T\approx T_{\rm vir}$ CGM forms a subsonic and angular momentum-conserving inflow down to the galaxy-halo interface, at which it cools to $T\lesssim10^4$ K (Figs.~\ref{f: before and after A} and \ref{f: before and after B}).
    Cooling occurs at the radius where rotational support in the flow becomes substantial, and is concurrent with flattening of the flow, i.e.~the flow transitions rapidly from a quasi-spherical hot medium into a cool thin disk (Figs. \ref{f: overview} and \ref{f: theta vs t}).
    Prior to cooling and flattening the hot flow decelerates and becomes coherently rotating with a narrow angular momentum distribution (Figure~\ref{f: coherence}), properties which we attribute to the subsonic nature of the flow (\S~\ref{s: why CFs thin disks}).
    Our results thus extend classic cooling flow theory by demonstrating rotating cooling flows are a primary accretion mode for many cosmologically-simulated galaxies, and by further exploring the mechanics of cooling flows with angular momentum beyond previous studies \citep{Cowie1980, Stern2019}. 
    \item \textbf{Relation between rotating cooling flows and thin stellar disks:}
    We find that across a sample of \Nsample~galaxies spanning $10^9 M_\odot < M_\star < 10^{11} M_\odot$, there is strong correlation between the dominance of cooling flow accretion and the fraction of stars formed in a thin disk in the central galaxy (Figs.~\ref{f: theta vs t}--\ref{f: prevalence}, Fig~\ref{f: prevalence - angular momentum}).
    This expands the result of \cite{Stern2021}, which found a relation between the formation of disks and the virialization of the inner CGM in FIRE, where the latter is a necessary condition for the onset of cooling flows. 
    We theorize that rotating cooling flows are conducive to the formation of thin disks since these flows achieve coherent, purely rotating kinematics prior to cooling to $\lesssim10^4$ K, and thus before any star-formation in the accreting gas takes place (Fig.~\ref{f: before and after A}, \S\ref{s: why CFs thin disks}).
    If rotating cooling flows are indeed a requirement for forming thin disks, then we expect thin disks mainly in relatively massive star-forming galaxies in which the CGM has virialized or is composed of subsonic gas, and at low redshift where cold flows are not expected to dominate the accretion.
    These trends are qualitatively consistent with observations which shows that thin disk morphologies are prevalent mainly in high mass and low-redshift star forming galaxies \citep{Kassin2012, Simons2017}.

% Compared to observable-ish thin disk fraction.
Figure~\ref{f: thin disk v thin disk} shows the relationship between the fraction of stars with $j/j_c(E)>0.8$ at $z=0$ ($f_{\rm thin\,disk,\,recent}$) and the same fraction of stars weighted by their Sloan r band luminosity-weighted.
The thin disk metric used throughout our analysis, $f_{\rm thin\,disk,\,recent}$ is closely related to the observationally-motivated luminosity-weighted thin disk fraction.

\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{f: counterexample} shows characteristic accretion onto a halo with a small (in this case nearly zero) thin disk fraction.
Such halos do not show the features of rotating cooling flows, as also seen in Figures~\ref{f: prevalence} and~\ref{f: prevalence - angular momentum}.

\section{Accretion onto other MW-mass halos}

Figures~\ref{f: before and after m12b} and~\ref{f: before and after m12c} show the combined equivalent of Figures~\ref{f: before and after A} and~\ref{f: before and after B} for two other Milky Way-mass halos.
The behavior is qualitatively very similar to each other and \texttt{m12i}.
This is summarized for additional simulations in Figures~\ref{f: prevalence} and~\ref{f: prevalence - angular momentum}.

\section{Accretion in cosmic ray-dominated halos}
\label{s: appendix-crs}

The accretion in cosmic ray-dominated halos is qualitatively similar to rotating cooling flows.
The exceptions are the temperature (panel A) and the energy balance (panel B): nonthermal support from cosmic rays (CRs) produces a $T\sim 10^4$ K, diffuse halo absent cooling flows.
As with rotating cooling flows accreting gas in this halo becomes coherently aligned \textit{prior to accretion}, a key mechanism that enables thin disk formation.
}
\label{f: before and after m12i cr}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{f: before and after m12i cr} shows the combined equivalent of Figures~\ref{f: before and after A} and~\ref{f: before and after B} for the same halo, but with an implementation of cosmic ray feedback~\cite{Chan2019, Hopkins2020a}.
Note that we center the trajectories on the time of first accretion instead of $\tcon$ because in CR-dominated halos much of the gas is never heated beyond $T = 10^5$ K.
This does not significantly affect the result, as accretion is largely concurrent with cooling in the halos without CRs.
This halo forms a thin disk ($f_{\rm thin\,disk,\,recent}=0.71$, which we argue may be a general feature of rotating subsonic flows~(\S\ref{s: why CFs thin disks}, \S\ref{s: crs}).

\section{Instantaneous mass flow}
\label{s: appendix-mass flow}

% HOT IN HALO
\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/Mdot.pdf}
    \caption{
    Average mass inflow rate over the course of one Gyr prior to $z=0$ in the same halos as in Figure~\ref{f: stars}, by gas temperature.
    The galaxy radius $r_{\rm gal}=4 r_{\star,0.5}$ and fraction of stars in a thin disk are marked in the panels. 
    Hot accretion ($T>10^5$ K) dominates the mass inflow onto thin-disk galaxies at $r \gtrsim r_{\rm gal} \sim 10-20$ kpc.
    Cold accretion ($T<10^5$ K) dominates within the galaxy in thin disk galaxies, and in the halo of the lower-mass irregular galaxy shown in the bottom-right panel.
    }
    \label{f: Mdot}
\end{figure*}

In this section we analyze if inflow is dominated by hot or cold gas, which allows us to distinguish a hot inflow from the accretion of cool clouds (formed, e.g., via instabilities).
Figure~\ref{f: Mdot} shows the mass inflow rate versus radius for hot gas (red curves; $T>10^5$ K) and for cool gas (blue curves; $T < 10^5\,{\rm K}$),  for the four simulations shown in Fig.~\ref{f: stars}. 
We calculate the mass inflow rate at a given radius as
\begin{equation}
     \Mdot(r) = \frac{\int_{\rm shell} v_r dm}{\Delta r} = \frac{M_{\rm shell}}{\Delta r} \langle v_r\rangle_{\rm mass\, weighted}
     \label{e: Mdot}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta r=0.05\,{\rm dex}$ is the shell thickness, and the integration is done on all particles with centers within the shell which satisfy the appropriate temperature cut. 

% Consequences
In the three MW-mass galaxies with a large thin disk fraction, at halo scales of $r>20$ kpc the inflow is dominated by hot gas, where in \texttt{m12i} and \texttt{m12b} $\Mdot$ of the hot gas is larger by a factor of $\gtrsim 4\times$ than that of cool gas.
The greater mass flux of hot gas indicates that the dominant form of accretion is an inflowing hot phase, rather than cold flows or cool clouds precipitating from the hot phase.
In contrast, in the lower mass galaxy shown in the bottom right the inflow is dominated by cool gas, while the hot gas is outflowing out to $\approx50$ kpc.
Fig.~\ref{f: Mdot} also shows that the inflow rate of hot gas in the MW-mass galaxies drops within $r_{\rm gal}$, reflecting the cooling of the hot inflow at the galaxy-halo interface, as shown in \S\ref{s: characteristics -- cools}.

\section{Notes on individual galaxies}

\label{s: appendix-individual}

% Presence of a rotating cooling flow for intermediate cases
The halos with $0.1 \lesssim f_{\rm thin\,disk,\,recent} < 0.5$ have varying levels of circularized cooling flow accretion.
Four of these six halos, \texttt{m12z}, \texttt{m12r}, \texttt{m12w}, and \texttt{m12m}, have $M_{\rm vir} \sim 10^{12} M_\odot$.
\texttt{m12z} has a chaotic halo with a number of ongoing mergers.
\texttt{m12r} has some ongoing thin disk formation, but is undergoing a major merger during the last Gyr that dominates the accreting gas supply and disrupts the galaxy structure.
This merger is relatively well-aligned with the disk, with $f_{\rm aligned} \approx 0.3-0.4$, and the aligned mass fraction does not change significantly as the gas cools past $\tcon$.
\texttt{m12w} is a galaxy with its inner CGM is only just virializing at $z=0$~\citep{Yu2021}, and the majority of the gas accretes with angular momentum perpendicular to the galaxy angular momentum.
Of these four the one with the highest thin disk fraction, \texttt{m12m}, is galaxy undergoing significant rotating cooling flow accretion, but absent a high thin disk fraction.
Visual inspection reveals that \texttt{m12m} has a prominent stellar bar.
\texttt{m12m} may be evidence that if rotating cooling flows are a condition for disk formation, they are a necessary-but-not-sufficient condition (\S\ref{s: why CFs thin disks}).
\texttt{m12m} is one of the few MW-mass halos that does not include metal diffusion, which may play a role in its morphology.
The $M_{\rm vir} \sim 10^11 M_\odot$ halos are \texttt{m11h} and \texttt{m11b} --- galaxies that are beginning to form disks despite their lower virial mass.
Much of their accretion is still isotropic, but alignment increases mildly post-cooling.
