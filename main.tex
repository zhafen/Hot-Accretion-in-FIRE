% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
\textit{
We compare the contribution of modes of accretion in the FIRE simulation in $L^\star$ halos between cold accretion, hot gas that condenses into clouds and accretes onto the galaxy (``precipitation''), and hot gas that accretes directly onto the galaxy as it cools.
We demonstrate that the primary mode of gas accretion in $L^\star$ halos is hot accretion directly onto the galactic disc.

% How we select the particles
\textit{
For a given galaxy we select all particles that are in the central galaxy at $z=0$ and in the CGM 1 Gyr prior.
The galaxy is defined as all gas and stars inside $R_{\rm gal} = 4 R_{\star,0.5}$, with an additional density cut of $n_{\rm H} = 0.13$ cm$^{-3}$ for gas.
The CGM is defined as all gas inside $0.1 -1 R_{\rm vir}$.
For each selected particle we retrieve the full history of the particle (including temperature, density, metallicity) throughout the simulation.
}

\textbf{Change the ``inside the galaxy'' radial cut to 0.1 $R_{\rm vir}$ as well and rerun.}

\textbf{The number of IDs that are accreted is 18554.
However, after removing duplicates, the number of IDs that are tracked is 14703.
Either $\sim20\%$ of the particles split, or this is a symptom of a bug.
Find out which.}


\begin{equation}
    \Rcool \equiv \text{max radius where} T<10^5\,{\rm K}
\end{equation}


the circularization radius $\Rcirc$ is defined via
\begin{equation}
    j = v_{\rm c}(\Rcirc)\Rcirc
\end{equation}
where $j$ is the specific angular momentum and $v_{\rm c}$ is the circular velocity
