% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
\textit{
We compare the contribution of modes of accretion in the FIRE simulation in $L^\star$ halos between cold accretion, hot gas that condenses into clouds and accretes onto the galaxy (``precipitation''), and hot gas that accretes directly onto the galaxy as it cools.
We demonstrate that the primary mode of gas accretion in $L^\star$ halos is hot accretion directly onto the galactic disc.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}
Two modes of hot accretion:
\begin{itemize}
    \item condensation (Maller \& Bullock 2004; Kaufmann, Bullock+09; McCourt+12; Voit+17)
    \item classic CF (Cowie+80; Paper I)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Intro TBD}

\section{Methods}

% Simulation sample
\textit{
We use four simulations:
m12i\_md\_7100, m12b\_md\_7100, m12f\_core\_7100, m12m\_core\_7100
}
\textbf{Also do massive galaxies?}

% How we select the particles
\textit{
For a given galaxy we select all particles that are in the central galaxy at $z=0$ and in the CGM 1 Gyr prior.
The galaxy is defined as all gas and stars inside $R_{\rm gal} = 4 R_{\star,0.5}$, with an additional density cut of $n_{\rm H} = 0.13$ cm$^{-3}$ for gas.
The CGM is defined as all gas inside $0.1 -1 R_{\rm vir}$.
For each selected particle we retrieve the full history of the particle (including temperature, density, metallicity) throughout the simulation.
}

\textbf{Change the ``inside the galaxy'' radial cut to 0.1 $R_{\rm vir}$ as well and rerun.}

\textbf{The number of IDs that are accreted for m12i is 18554.
However, after removing duplicates, the number of IDs that are tracked is 14703.
Either $\sim20\%$ of the particles split, or this is a symptom of a bug.
Find out which.}


\begin{equation}
    \Rcool \equiv \text{max radius where} T<10^5\,{\rm K}
\end{equation}


the circularization radius $\Rcirc$ is defined via
\begin{equation}
    j = v_{\rm c}(\Rcirc)\Rcirc
\end{equation}
where $j$ is the specific angular momentum and $v_{\rm c}$ is the circular velocity

    \textbf{Add all particles with $R_{T=10^5\K}>100$ to $R=100$ bin, so we don't ignore them}
    \textbf{Is this only m12i? lets see same plot for other sims (maybe not eventually to go into paper).}
    \textbf{Add another panel with K vs.~R for the same particles.}
    \textbf{Add in coloring by $t - t_{\rm{condense}}$.}
    \textbf{Make y-axis T but in log space (not log T).}
    \textbf{Add label to 0.1$R_{\rm vir}$.}
    \textbf{Make upper panel less tall, so its clear its an addendum to the bottom panel}

    \caption{
    Distribution of $\Rcool$ vs j($\Rcool$) for four FIRE-2 halos with $L(z=0) \sim L^\star$.
Thick (thin) contours enclose values for 50\% (90\%) of the accreted gas particles.
The angular momentum as a function of radius for all gas in \texttt{m12i} at $z=0$ is displayed as a dashed line (the median) and shaded regions (5th-95th percentiles).
\textbf{The contours appear to match well with the circular velocity, but in reality so does the angular momentum of all gas at $z=0$, it's just that there are many order of magnitude on the y axis. In fact, the angular momentum of all gas at $z=0$ matches better, maybe??}
\textbf{Maybe add in a line that indicates the angular momentum necessary for full support?}
\textbf{Does the 100 kpc-cooling gas only occur in simulations without metal diffusion? If so, is it seen for particularly metal-enriched particles?}
\textbf{Is the 100 kpc-cooling gas related to satellite galaxies?}
\textit{
In all halos the distributions are consistent with $j_{\rm c} = v_{\rm c} r$, i.e. gas cools once circularized.
This demonstrates that the variable angular momentum of incoming gas drives the width in the $\Rcool$ distribution.

    After cooling the gas is primarily found in the disk at $\cos\ \theta = 0$.
    }
    \label{f: theta vs R}
\end{figure}

% Distribution of r1e5
\textit{
Isotropic cooling occurring randomly within $R_{\rm vir}$ would cool in a wide distribution with a median at $0.8 R_{\rm vir}$, while for our accreted gas the median $\Rcool \approx 0.06 R_{\rm vir}$.

\section{Discussion}

\textbf{
We should make it clear why the gas cools so quickly at the angular momentum radius when the definition of inner CGM virialization is $t_{\rm cool} > t_{\rm ff}$.
This could be a point of confusion for the readers (it at least is for me).
Is it due to pile-up of material, increasing density and driving cooling?

\subsection{AGN feedback}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Results expected to be valid after disc forms (Paper III) and before AGN feedback kicks in (ref.~Byrne+)
    \item Results are baseline for detecting effects of feedback in observations / simulations
    
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Contrast with Precipitation}

\textbf{We should note that we may lack the resolution necessary to see true precipitation.}
