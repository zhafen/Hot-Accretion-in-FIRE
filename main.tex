% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}

We study how gas accretes onto $\sim L^\star$ star-forming galaxies at redshift $z\sim0$ using the FIRE cosmological simulations. We evaluate the relative importance of three modes of accretion: gas that never heats to the virial temperature (`cold accretion'), hot gas that condenses into cool clouds in the halo which then accretes onto the galaxy (``condensation''), and gas that remains hot down to the galaxy scale at which point it circularizes and cools (`cooling flow'). 
We demonstrate that across our sample of 4 MW-mass halos the primary mode of gas accretion is `cooling flow', with an inflow rate $\sim xx\times$ that of other accretion modes. Cooling gas changes from an irregular morphology without a preferred direction to strong alignment with the galactic plane within $\sim 100$ Myr of cooling.
Accretion via condensation is only associated with satellites (?). Cold accretion does not occur in significant quantities in our sample. 
% Using particle tracking we demonstrate that gas remains hot until it cools when it circularizes at $\lesssim 0.1 R_{\rm vir}$.
% \textit{Gas cools after circularizing because it is no longer undergoing compressional heating that offsets cooling.}
% \textbf{Check the numbers.}

\section{Introduction}

% Accretion in cosmological simulations
\textbf{Ho,Martin+2019}

% Modes of hot accretion
\textit{
Two modes of hot accretion:
\begin{itemize}
    \item condensation (Maller \& Bullock 2004; Kaufmann, Bullock+09; McCourt+12; Voit+17)
    \item classic CF (Cowie+80; Paper I)
\end{itemize}
}

% Observational signatures
\textbf{
Kregel+02; van der Kruit+07;  MartÃ­n-Navarro+12; Comeron+12 all discuss the observed ``truncation radius'' of disc galaxies roughly at $\sim$4 effective radii.
Our $\Rcool$ may explain this truncation.
}

% Related work
\textbf{Oppenheimer+2018  show increased angular momentum in the inner halo, consistent with our results.
Huscher+2020 also have relevant ang momentum work.}

\section{Methods}

% Simulation sample
\textit{
We use four simulations:
m12i\_md\_7100, m12b\_md\_7100, m12f\_core\_7100, m12m\_core\_7100
}
\textbf{Also do massive galaxies?}
\textbf{Do more metal diffusion simulations (the non-md sims have unexpected cooling at large radii): at least 4 metal diffusion simulations would be good.}

% How we select the particles
\textit{
For a given galaxy we select all particles that are in the central galaxy at $z=0$ and in the CGM 1 Gyr prior.
The galaxy is defined as all gas and stars inside $R_{\rm gal} = 0.1 R_{\rm vir}$, with an additional density cut of $n_{\rm H} = 0.13$ cm$^{-3}$ for gas.
The CGM is defined as all gas inside $0.1 -1 R_{\rm vir}$.
For each selected particle we retrieve the full history of the particle (including temperature, density, metallicity) throughout the simulation.
}

\textbf{The number of IDs that are accreted for m12i is 18554.
However, after removing duplicates, the number of IDs that are tracked is 14703.
Either $\sim20\%$ of the particles split, or this is a symptom of a bug.
Find out which.}

% Definition of t1e5 and calculating it
\textit{
$\tcon$ is the latest time among our particles at which the particle transitions from $T > 10^5$ K to $T< 10^5$ K.
(When selecting values in the simulation corresponding to $\tcon$ we use the last snapshot an accreted particle had $T > 10^5$ K, i.e. the snapshot immediately before the transition.)
Note that we do not account for gas particles being heated to $T > 10^5$ K while still in the ISM.
Because our sample of tracked particles focuses on recently accreted particles this is expected to be a small population that will not contaminate our analysis.
This is confirmed after-the-fact in Figure~\ref{f: theta vs R}, where gas is not preferentially oriented in a disky ISM prior to $\tcon$.
}
\textbf{We could select out ISM-heated particles, if necessary, but as noted above Figure~\ref{f: theta vs R} shows that this is not an issue.}

\begin{equation}
    \Rcool \equiv R(t_{T=10^5\,{\rm K}})
\end{equation}


\textit{the circularization radius $\Rcirc$ is defined via}
\begin{equation}
    j = v_{\rm c}(\Rcirc)\Rcirc
\end{equation}
\textit{where $j$ is the specific angular momentum and $v_{\rm c}$ is the circular velocity.}

\textbf{When calculating the cooling function I just used Y=0.2485. That should be fine, right?}

% Accretion tracks figure description
\textit{
The main panels of Figure~\ref{f: T vs R} show the paths in temperature-radius and entropy-radius space taken by accreting particles.
}

% Distribution of r1e5
\textit{
As an explicit example of how far our distribution is from a condensation model, isotropic cooling occurring randomly within $R_{\rm vir}$ would cool in a wide distribution with a median at $0.8 R_{\rm vir}$, while for our accreted gas the median $\Rcool \approx 0.06 R_{\rm vir}$.
}
\textit{We added all particles with $\Rcool>100$ to $R=100$ bin, so we don't ignore them.}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{AGN feedback}

\textit{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Results expected to be valid after disc forms (Paper III) and before AGN feedback kicks in (ref.~Byrne+)
    \item Results are baseline for detecting effects of feedback in observations / simulations
\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Contrast with Condensation/Precipitation}

\textbf{Discuss resolution effects and Balbus\&Soker}
