% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
We study how gas accretes onto $\sim L^\star$ star-forming galaxies at redshift $z\sim0$ using the FIRE cosmological simulations. We evaluate the relative importance of three different modes of accretion: 
gas that never heats to the virial temperature (``cold accretion''), 
cool clouds which condense out of the hot halo, lose buoyancy and accrete  (``condensation''), 
and inflowing hot gas which remains hot down to the galaxy scale (``cooling flow''). 
We demonstrate that across our sample of $xx$ MW-mass halos most accretion occurs via a cooling flow, accounting for $yy-zz\%$ of all accreted gas. Gas accreted in this mode is hot and quasi-spherical down to $\lesssim 0.1$ of the halo virial radius, at which point it simulataneously cools and circularizes, thus joining the outskirts of the galactic disc. 
% Only a small fraction ($zz$\%) of this hot flow experienced condensation and reheating prior to accretion. 
The remaining $vv-ww\%$ of accreted gas originates in cool clouds which condensed out of the halo. Cold accretion does not occur in appreciable quantities at $z\sim0$ in our simulations. 
\textbf{
Include: Comparison of angular momentum radius to disk radius, making the connection between disk feeding and disk size.
Disk size can be uniquely characterized in observations by a knee in the stellar profile.
}
\textbf{
Include: Compare Mdotcool with the accretion rate and SFR to further strengthen the relation, maybe through Figure 1 in an energetic sense.

% Modes of hot accretion
\textit{
Two modes of hot accretion:
\begin{itemize}
    \item condensation (Maller \& Bullock 2004; Kaufmann, Bullock+09; McCourt+12; Voit+17)
    \item classic CF (Cowie+80; Paper I)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Intro TBD}

\textbf{Info-dump from Jonathan:}
Some refs on truncation radius in observations:
Kregel+02: tight correlation between disk truncation radius and Re (Spearman 0.95) in 34 edge-on spirals (in face-on galaxies stellar halos can outshine truncation, see Martín-Navarro+14). $R_truncation / R\_e(I-band) \sim~ 3.6$. Somewhat higher ratio in small Re spirals, somewhat lower ratio in bluer passbands (where Re is larger). Re is independently found to be proportional to the virial radius, roughly Re ~ 0.011 Rvir (e.g. Kravtsov13)
Martín-Navarro+12: 34 edge-on spirals from SDSS / S4G: Rtruncation ~ 1.1 R25, where R25 is the radius at which the surface brightness equals 25mag
van der Kruit+07: when a HI-warp is present in the gaseous disc it starts at 1.1 Rtrunc; the truncation radius and the onset of the warps coincide radially sometimes with features in the rotation curve and often with steep declines in the HI surface density; inner disks are very flat and the onset of the warp just beyond the truncation radius is abrupt and discontinuous;
Perez+04, Trujillo\&Pohlen05, Azzollini+08: measurements of truncation radius at z~1
Comeron+12: 70 edge-on S4G galaxies. 77\% of thin discs truncate, but only 31\% of thick discs. $M_thick/M_thin$ increases with decreasing $v_c$
de Jong+07: Stellar Populations across the NGC 4244 Truncated Galactic Disk
Haberzettl+07: truncation in LSBs

and short summary sentence from Comeron+12 intro:
"Several theories compete for explaining the origin of such breaks. Truncations have been explained by dynamical arguments related to the conservation of angular momentum during galaxy formation, by star formation thresholds, and by the redistribution of angular momentum by a bar. Antitruncations have in some cases been linked to interactions and mergers."
Antitruncations are cases where the Surface Brightness profiles flattens at large disc radii rather than steepens. From my impression of the observational literature anti-truncations are seen mainly in face-on galaxies and are related to the existence of stellar halos

\section{Methods}

% Simulation sample
\textit{
We use four simulations:
m12i\_md\_7100, m12b\_md\_7100, m12f\_core\_7100, m12m\_core\_7100
}
\textbf{Also do massive galaxies?}
\textbf{Do more metal diffusion simulations (the non-md sims have unexpected cooling at large radii): at least 4 metal diffusion simulations would be good.}

% How we select the particles
\textit{
For a given galaxy we select all particles that are in the central galaxy at $z=0$ and in the CGM 1 Gyr prior.
The galaxy is defined as all gas and stars inside $R_{\rm gal} = 0.1 R_{\rm vir}$, with an additional density cut of $n_{\rm H} = 0.13$ cm$^{-3}$ for gas.
The CGM is defined as all gas inside $0.1 -1 R_{\rm vir}$.
For each selected particle we retrieve the full history of the particle (including temperature, density, metallicity) throughout the simulation.
}

\textbf{The number of IDs that are accreted for m12i is 18554.
However, after removing duplicates, the number of IDs that are tracked is 14703.
Either $\sim20\%$ of the particles split, or this is a symptom of a bug.
Find out which.}

% Definition of t1e5 and calculating it
\textit{
$\tcon$ is the latest time among our particles at which the particle transitions from $T > 10^5$ K to $T< 10^5$ K.
(When selecting values in the simulation corresponding to $\tcon$ we use the last snapshot an accreted particle had $T > 10^5$ K, i.e. the snapshot immediately before the transition.)
Note that we do not account for gas particles being heated to $T > 10^5$ K while still in the ISM.
Because our sample of tracked particles focuses on recently accreted particles this is expected to be a small population that will not contaminate our analysis.
This is confirmed after-the-fact in Figure~\ref{f: theta vs R}, where gas is not preferentially oriented in a disky ISM prior to $\tcon$.
}
\textbf{We could select out ISM-heated particles, if necessary, but as noted above Figure~\ref{f: theta vs R} shows that this is not an issue.}

\begin{equation}
    \Rcool \equiv R(t_{T=10^5\,{\rm K}})
\end{equation}


\textit{the circularization radius $\Rcirc$ is defined via}
\begin{equation}
    j = v_{\rm c}(\Rcirc)\Rcirc
\end{equation}
\textit{where $j$ is the specific angular momentum and $v_{\rm c}$ is the circular velocity.}

\textbf{When calculating the cooling function I just used Y=0.2485. That should be fine, right?}

\section{Results}

We calculate the mass inflow rate as
\begin{equation}\label{e:Mdot}
     \Mdot = \frac{\int_{\rm shell} v_r dm}{\Delta r} = \frac{M_{\rm shell}}{\Delta r} \langle v_r\rangle_\rho
\end{equation}
where $\Delta r$ is the shell thickness, and the integration is done on all particles which center is within the shell. Mass-weighted averaging is noted by $\langle\cdot\rangle_\rho$.

\textbf{TBD: $\dot{M}_{\rm stars}$ in Fig.~\ref{f:Mdot} is currently SFR$/2$. Change to SFR minus gas returned from winds/SNe.}

}

% Distribution of r1e5
\textit{
As an explicit example of how far our distribution is from a condensation model, isotropic cooling occurring randomly within $R_{\rm vir}$ would cool in a wide distribution with a median at $0.8 R_{\rm vir}$, while for our accreted gas the median $\Rcool \approx 0.06 R_{\rm vir}$.
}
\textit{We added all particles with $\Rcool>100$ to $R=100$ bin, so we don't ignore them.}

\subsection{Energetics}

To demonstrate that the hot radial inflow is driven by cooling, we compare the different terms of the energy conservation equation. In steady-state, and assuming the gravitationaly potential is constant,  energy conservation in the radial direction dictates \citep[e.g.][]{Shu82}
\begin{equation}\label{e:energy}
    \rho g v_r + H_{\rm feedback} - \frac{d}{dr}(v_r P)= 
    \frac{d}{dr}\left(\rho v_r \left(\epsilon+\frac{1}{2}v^2\right)\right)  +  \nH^2\Lambda  
\end{equation}
where the terms on the left hand side are the `source terms' -- gravity, feedback, and the work done on the shell by adjacent shells, while the terms on the right represent respectively the heating and acceleration of the flow and radiative losses. 
Integrating over radial shells and rearranging we get the energy integral
\begin{equation}
    \Mdot\frac{d}{dr}\left(\Phi+\frac{3}{2}\epsilon + \frac{1}{2}v^2\right) = 4\pi r^2 \left(\langle\nH^2\Lambda\rangle-\langle H_{\rm feedback}\rangle\right)
\end{equation}

In Fig.~\ref{f:Edot} we plot each of the terms in eqn.~(\ref{e:energy}), averaged over radial shells and over time. Shell averages of quantity $Q$ are calculated via 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\dot{E}_Q}{d r} = \frac{\int_{\rm shell} Q\rho^{-1} dm}{\Delta r} 
\end{equation}
where the intergral is over all particles within the shell and $\Delta r$ is the thickness of the shell. The factor $\rho^{-1}$ is since eqn.~\ref{e:energy} is in Eulerian form. We then take the average of all shells at a given $r$ in snapshots of the last Gyr of the simulation. 
% In order to calculate the compression term from a single snapshot, we make the following further approximation \textbf{(TBD: check if justified)}
% \begin{equation}
%     \frac{d\dot{E}_{\rm comp}}{d r} \approx 
%     \Mdot P \left\langle\frac{d V}{d r}\right\rangle_{\rho v_r} \approx
%     \Mdot P \frac{d\langle V \rangle_{\rho v_r} }{dr}
% \end{equation}
% Note that since $d\ln\rho/ d\ln r$ is of order unity, and in hot virial temperature gas $\epsilon/r \approx c_{\rm s}^2/r \approx v_{\rm c}^2/r = g$, we get that $\dot{E}_{\rm comp}$ (eqn.~\ref{e:Ecomp}) and $\dot{E}_{\rm grav}$ (eqn.~\ref{e:Egrav}) are of the same order.
\section{Discussion}


\subsection{AGN feedback}

\textit{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Results expected to be valid after disc forms (Paper III) and before AGN feedback kicks in (ref.~Byrne+)
    \item Results are baseline for detecting effects of feedback in observations / simulations
\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Contrast with other accretion mechanisms}

\subsubsection{Condensation/Precipitation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Nelson+20
    \item Esmerian+20
\end{itemize}
emphasize cold clouds due to over-densities heat back up and join the hot inflow, as in Illustris (see fig.~12 in Nelson+20
